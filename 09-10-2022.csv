The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows that most of the suicides in Ludhiana were because of mental illness/ insanity. Experts say that despite the fall in suicides cases in 2021, the number was more than 300 and needs to be brought down. As per the NCRB data, 307 suicide cases were registered in Ludhiana in 2021. Of these, 236 were by men and the remaining by women. In 2020, the number of such cases was 355. Therefore, the cases dropped by 13.5%. It is after 2015 that suicide cases decreased as compared with the previous year. In 2020, the rise as compared with the preceding year was the highest at 39.8%. In 2021, Amritsar recorded 69 suicide cases, Chandigarh 120 and Srinagar 18. The case decrease in the region was the highest for Amritsar at 28.9%, followed by Ludhiana (13.5%). Chandigarh cases witnessed a fall of 6.3%. An analysis of sub-categories of suicide cases of Ludhiana city shows that the maximum suicides (192) were due to illness. Of these, 146 were by men and 46 by women. In the category, 179 were due to insanity / mental illness (138 by men and 41 by women). In 2020, too, the maximum suicides (215) were due to illness, of which 190 were due to insanity / mental illness. In 2019, the number of suicides due to mental illness / insanity was 103. The report states that in 2021, six students (three males) committed suicide due to failure in examination. It was one less than in 2020. As many as 20 persons, including 11 males, had ended their lives due to marital issues. Poverty prompted 12 persons to end their lives. Twelve persons committed suicide because of drug abuse / alcohol addiction in 2021; the figure was 10 in the preceding year. Two persons had ended their lives because of unemployment, nine due to property disputes and eight due to love affairs. Experts say after lockdown in 2020, people had started to socialise, which may be one of the reasons for fall in suicides in the city. ""More than 13% fall in suicide cases is a positive news, but the number can be brought down below 300 in the city. This can be done with lifestyle modification, meditation and pursuing hobbies, among others. The fall in suicide cases is apparently due to start of socialisation by people in 2021. In 2020, due to lockdown, there were restrictions on socialization and conflicts increased due to confinement at home, which led to increase in stress among people. As mental ventilation of people, which normally happens when they meet people, didn't happen, it resulted in mental problems,"" says city-based psychiatrist Dr Anshu Gupta.

40,BHUBANESWAR,['21-year-old'],Bhubaneswar police to launch suicide prevention helpline,"BHUBANESWAR: Alarmed by a spurt in suicides in Bhubaneswar in the last few days, the commissionerate police has decided to launch a suicide prevention helpline number. The police recently held a first round of discussions with some eminent psychiatrists and sought their assistance to train a group of constables and senior officers, who would man the helpline centre. The constables and officers would learn the basic of counselling so that they can dissuade a person from taking the extreme step. ""We have observed that most of the suicides occurred late at night. We plan to operate the helpline 24x7 so that a person in need can seek help at odd hours,"" a senior police officer said. Mental Health Institute, a centre of excellence of SCB Medical College and Hospital at Cuttack runs a helpline number 18003457288 to counsel patients suffering from mental illness and having suicidal tendencies. “Not many people are aware of such a helpline. So, we hardly receive calls seeking our intervention for suicide prevention,” Sukanya Mahakul, a clinical psychologist of the helpline centre. While 5546 people died by suicide in 2020, altogether 5651 people ended their lives in 2021, the statistics of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) said. Over a dozen suicide cases have been reported in the capital city in the last two months, triggering concerns about negligence towards mental health. On Friday, a 21-year-old girl died by suicide in her home in Laxmisagar area here after being allegedly scolded by her parents on her personal issue. Another man, who was a drug addict, hung himself in his home in Airfield police area on Friday. On Wednesday, a BTech student allegedly died by suicide at railway colony here over her family dispute. Recent suicides by BJB college student Ruchika Mohanty, Ollywood actor Rai Mohan Parida, software engineer Sweta Utkal Kumari and MCA student Ashrita Senapati, and nursing student Kuni Kanhar left the police on their toes. Police said many suicides can be prevented if the victims get timely counselling. The police cited the example of the nursing student Kuni Kanhar, who allegedly hung herself on September 4 from prolonged insomnia. Though her family members, hostel mates and college authorities were aware of her sleep disorder, they did not seek the help of any doctor or psychiatrist.

Maharashtra's burden with 22,207 lives ended was the heaviest (13.5% of the overall number). A comparison with pre-Covid 2019 revealed an 18% increase in suicides in India in the two-year period. While 1.39 lakh suicides were registered in 2019, the number increased to 1.53 lakh in 2020 and shot up to 1.64 lakh in 2021, showed the data. The economic effect of the pandemic was reflected in the breakup of deaths by professions: a fourth of the people who died by suicide in 2021 were daily wage-earners. Self-employed people or small-time traders were the second biggest group (12.3%) while students made up for 8% of the toll.A comparison of 2019 and 2021 showed a sharp increase in percentage points of self-employed people who took their own lives (almost 26%). Similarly, 27% more students killed themselves in 2021 (13,089) as against 2019 (10,335). ""Just ahead of World Suicide Prevention Day on September 10, the latest NCRB figures are sobering,'' said Dr Anant Bhan of the Centre for Mental Health, Law & Policy. Though the data revealed that 2021 had the highest suicides in a year, Dr Bhan felt the numbers are still an underestimation. ""This is from the police records, but there could be more,'' he said. ""Sudden increase of suicides is an indicator of the mental health epidemic post-Covid that's affected people across India,"" said psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty. ""The fact remains that the poor remain invisible to policy makers in the health sector across the country,"" he said.Experts said the data should be used to underline the triggers and social determinants associated with suicide. ""It is not enough to do basic transfer of funds. We need to focus on developing a holistic approach to mental health issues,"" said Dr Bhan. Dr Shetty said the need of the hour is a conscious people's movement as the Swachha Bharat Abhiyan.  Former Sion dean Dr Suleman Merchant said the reasons for suicide varies and depends on age and gender. ""In many cases it's an impulse and not necessarily due to chronic mental health issues. Temporary bad circumstances seem insurmountable at that time. All seems lost. If someone can be there for them, showing they care (even just to listen) the impulse can be overcome."" Dr Merchant said during the lockdown, staying indoors contributed to such tendencies as it deprived people of the sunshine vitamin, Vit D.

While no suicide note has been found by the cops, the AIIMS-R administration has said that the boy was suffering from depression. Harish Thapliyal, public relations officer, AIIMS-Rishikesh, said, “Recently, Rajat had to be admitted to the psychiatry ward of AIIMS-Rishikesh as he was suffering from depression and other mental health issues. Later, on May 19, he was discharged from the ward. We have informed his family of the death.” Thapliyal added, “As he was a second-year student, we can rule out the “ragging angle”. Besides, our fee is just Rs 750 per month, so, a financial burden also couldn’t be the reason behind his suicide.” TOI sources in the medical institution said that the boy may have taken the extreme step due to academic pressure. He recently failed in two subjects and was depressed due to his poor academic performance, said AIIMS authorities.

Depression over her personal life reportedly led 22-year-old Ashrita Senapati to take such an extreme step, police said. Though the police seized a suicide note purportedly written by Senapati from her room, they did not disclose its contents. “We are trying to ascertain the exact cause of her death. Her friends and family members will be questioned. No formal complaint has been received from her family yet,” deputy commissioner of police Prateek Singh said. Senapati, who belonged to Tihidi area of Bhadrak district, was a first-year MCA student. She had been staying alone here. When she did not pick up her father’s phone calls in the morning, her family members asked the house owner to check whether she was present in her room. Repeated attempts by the house owner also went in vain as she did not open the door. Sensing foul play, the family members informed the police, who broke open the door and found her hanging. The back-to-back deaths of Ruchika Mohanty (committed suicide on July 2) and Ashrita Senapati has turned the spotlight on the disturbing trend of a large number of students committing suicides in Odisha. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), Odisha stood second after Maharashtra for reporting maximum number of student suicides in 2020. While 1,648 students had committed suicide in Maharashtra in 2020, Odisha was placed second with 1,469 suicides (1,042 males and 427 females) by students. At least 379 students had committed suicide in Odisha in 2019, 501 in 2018 and 361 in 2017, the NCRB report said. “Prolonged battle with stress and the failure to withstand the stress always trigger suicidal tendency among people.

The postmortem report had revealed that the girl, who died by suicide, was raped, and her parents have been alleging since then that the cops were trying to protect the people behind her death as they were rich and politically influential. Rural district crime branch DSP Johnson KJ, who heads the investigation, on Saturday rubbished the allegations, and said that the investigation could not find enough proof to charge anyone with abetting the girl’s suicide. The case registered at Kanjiramkulam police station under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was handed over to the crime branch after the parents of the girl approached the chief minister and DGP seeking a transparent probe in January 2021. The Plus-One student had rushed to her room after receiving a phone call on September 25, 2020 and ended her life by hanging herself in her room. “Days before her death, she was seen speaking angrily to someone, but she did not disclose anything to us. She told us that she will be killed if anything is revealed but we did not expect her to take this extreme step. A young man from the locality had proposed to her and her friends had noticed them speaking several times. His parents are very rich and influential, and the investigating officers say there is no evidence against him,” said the girl’s mother. Meanwhile, the police approached the Pocso court a few days ago seeking more time to complete the probe. “The DNA from the vaginal swabs did not match with any of the suspects. Her phone call details were also examined, and people close to her were also questioned but we could not find any clue. We are still hopeful as the investigation is on,” said Johnson.

They raised slogans against the university administration alleging that in 2018 a student had committed suicide in the girls' hostel but no probe was done. A resident of Gomtinagar, Anjali was a student of BEd (II) semester. Students alleged that several BEd students, including Anjali, had got low scores in a subject in the semester examination and had asked for re-evaluation which was rejected by the university officials. ""Since all girls in the hostel are speech impaired, they could not call up university officials or raise an alarm. They tried to break open the door and succeeded after repeated attempts,"" a boy hosteller explained to TOI through sign language. The interpretation was done by another student. He said all hostel girls were shivering and had broken down while sharing how challenging it was for them to make an attempt to save Anjali. Earlier, fit students also lived in the hostel and would help their differently abled batchmates. Now only a single student lives in one hostel room due to Covid-19.

67,BHUBANESWAR,[],‘Let’s pay attention to pre-suicide signs’,"BHUBANESWAR: The state has witnessed a spurt in suicide cases in the last few months that has turned the spotlight on the necessity to address mental health issues. According to NCRB’s statistics, 5,546 people, including 1,637 women died by suicide in the state in 2020 and 5,651 people, including 1,239 women ended their lives in 2021. Some of recent suicide cases include the alleged suicides by BJB college student Ruchika Mohanty, Ollywood actor Raimohan Parida, judge Subash Kumar Behari, among others. But the moot question remains as to why the suicide rate is alarming in Odisha. Experts believe that the cause of suicide cannot be attributed to a single reason. They believe that suicides are triggered or caused by different factors. Family disputes, domestic violence, marital discord, failure in examinations, illness and bankruptcy, among other causes can be attributed to suicides by people of different professions and age groups. Many people often end their lives in their productive age, said eminent psychiatrist from Pune Soumitra Pathare. The state reported the highest share of suicides due to family problems in the country in 2021. Altogether 4,033 suicides (3,257 females) were reported due to family problems. Pathare said, “Most suicides are preceded by warning signs, either verbal or behavioural. Many will talk to friends and relatives or doctors about wanting to die”. He said about 50% of the suicide victims have a pre-existing mental illness. According to Pathare, people with mental illness are not necessarily suicidal and those who die by suicide do not necessarily suffer from mental illness. Pathare said suicides can be prevented if the issues plaguing the patients can be properly and timely addressed. “We need to identify the problem areas. Suicides are associated with interpersonal/family violence and alcohol. Reducing family violence and harmful use of alcohol can also reduce suicides. If students are committing more suicides, the government, police, teachers and parents should conduct regular sensitisation programmes in educational institutions,” Pathare said. Amrit Pattjoshi, a Bhubaneswar-based senior psychiatrist, said depression and mental illness are treatable. “If you know someone is depressed, give them emotional support, encourage them to seek treatment and share positive stories or good news with him. Incidents of suicide not just affect the near and dear of the deceased persons, but also trigger panic and anxiety among many people, who develop suicidal tendency,” Pattjoshi said ",05-09-2022,"['suicide', 'issues', 'died', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'moot', 'suicide', 'alarming', 'suicide', 'discord', 'failure', 'illness', 'problems', 'problems', 'warning', 'suicide', 'illness', 'illness', 'suicidal', 'suicide', 'suffer', 'illness', 'issues', 'problem', 'harmful', 'depression', 'illness', 'depressed', 'suicide', 'panic', 'anxiety', 'suicidal']"

The officer was transferred from Aluva East police station to police headquarters on Wednesday but the opposition parties -- led by the Congress -- were continuing their protest. The Congress called off its sit-in protest in front of Aluva East police station following the suspension. Mofiya (21), who took her life on Monday night, had filed a police complaint earlier against domestic violence and dowry-related harassment. Her family alleged that the inspector verbally abused Mofiya and her father Dilshad K Salim when they went to the police station for a discussion. An FIR was also not registered on her complaint. The suspension order, issued by state police chief Anil Kant, said the DIG (Ernakulam range) had submitted a ""special report"" against Sudheer and it prima facie revealed ""certain lapses in the disposal of the petition submitted by Mofiya Parveen against her husband"". Kant also ordered an oral inquiry against Sudheer and authorized Francis Shelbi, ACP (Traffic East), Kochi City to conduct the probe. The suspension was made public hours after minister P Rajeeve visited Mofiya's parents. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan interacted with Mofiya's father Dilshad over phone when Rajeeve was at their home. Dilshad said besides promising action against the culprits, the chief minister has given his phone number to contact if they found any problem with the ongoing probe. The district crime branch team, probing the case, on Friday collected detailed statements from Mofiya's family members. It will be seeking the custody of Mofiya's husband Muhammed Suhail (27) and in-laws Rukhya (55) and Yousuf (63) soon.

While the rate of suicide in Odisha stands at 12.3% against the national average of 12%, as many as 226 people have died by suicide in the capital city alone in the last eight months, police sources said. Experts cited some of the reasons for increasing cases of suicide as the pandemic, overindulgence in social media, weakening of family bonds, peer pressure and relationship issues. “Suicide is not a solution to problems but a cry for help. Most suicide deaths are preventable. It is very important to identify the warning signs, make people talk, and speak up about what are they going through and thinking about,” said Dr Suvendu Narayan Mishra, professor in psychiatry, SUM Hospital. Experts pointed out that students have become more vulnerable to suicide and are taking extreme steps at the drop of a hat. “We have realised the need for more such events that will create an awareness among the youth and help them speak up and share what they are going through,” Jhumki Rath, head of the department of psychology, BJB Autonomous College. Dr Sai Chandan Das, associate professor of community medicine at Fakir Mohan Medical College and Hospital showcased a short film to create awareness on prevention of suicides. Director of Manam Foundation Anuradha Mohapatra said, “There has been an increase in suicides due to spurt in mental issues, lack of proper grooming in childhood, among others.” Department of Mental Health, SUM Nursing College, faculty of nursing of SOA University organiszed a workshop on Saturday where experts said 80% suicides are preventable.

70,RAJKOT,[],"Covid kills teenagers’ willpower, pushes many over the edge in Gujarat","RAJKOT: While the education sector squarely blamed the pandemic for ruining students’ career prospects, very little insight went into finding out how the Covid-19 damaged the young individuals. It not only robbed them of their self-confidence and mental agility but also replaced it with despairing thoughts that helped push many weaklings to the brink of self-destruction. Even though it has had the dubious distinction of being the state’s suicide capital, 17 suicides of teens in their prime since last March have shaken Saurashtra to its core. According to data, a majority of these cases are students in Class 10 and 12 who decided to end life out of their extreme fear of failure in exams, while a few were in their undergraduate years. Psychologists have now emphasized good parenting to prevent these tragedies. The pattern of self-annihilation has remained the same in most cases – hanging themselves in the sanctuary of their rooms when left alone at home. However, in some bizarre cases, the demoralized young even chose to set themselves on fire to end their apprehensions. Psychologists opine that the abnormal behaviour stems from the children’s failing mental stamina to conquer the unknown after the ravaging onslaught of Covid. While the students had been studying online throughout the year, their assumption of sitting for online exams or even getting a mass promotion was drastically dashed with the fall in Covid cases and the education boards’ decision to conduct in-person exams. The head of the psychology department at Saurashtra University (SU), Yogesh Jogsan said, “The mass promotion policy triggered lethargy in the students who had become very adapted to the online mode of education. Coupled with that was GenX’s overachieving mentality. The fear of defeat gnawed on their impressive minds which pushed them to such extremities.” Ahmedabad police, however, claim that in a few cases of suicide in the city, the reason behind the extreme step cannot be attributed to exam phobia. They said that the deceased neither left behind any suicide note nor exhibited any pressure from studies in front of their family or friends. In Vadodara, in a most recent case of suicide, a Class 12 student took his life a day before his preliminary exams were to start on Thursday. The police have attributed it to the teen’s exam tension, while stating that another Class 12 student, who took her life in a similar manner in February, hanged to death out of depression. “To prevent such young suicides, good parenting is a pre-requisite,” said Jogsan, who adds that parents should never impose their ambitions on children. This, he says, leaves the kids in an emotional turmoil that nobody in the family ever addresses.

We have buddies/volunteers in each branch for each batch, who try to identify students who appear to have difficulties and bring it to the notice of counsellors, who then take over to help the students. We have three permanent employees as counsellors, who stay on campus,"" the statement read.  ""Unfortunately, in the case of Rahul, he never showed any signs of depression. He celebrated his birthday four days before the incident and two days before the incident he celebrated India's victory over Pakistan in the cricket match along with his friends.

74,"For decades, mental health issues have been plaguing postgraduate medical students who are often treated as the unpaid workforce across medical college hospitals. The issue came to the fore recently when Dr Vijay Oza, president of the Post-Graduate Medical Education Board (PGMEB), National Medical Commission (NMC), said that NMC received grievances from PG students (resident doctors) stating they are under stress due to long working hours, no weekly offs, non-sanctioning of leaves during emergency etc. Consequently, the Commission has urged the medical colleges to take care of their students’ mental well-being by addressing such issues, submit action-taken reports and the practice they follow with special mention of cases of suicide, among other challenges. Corroborating the fact, Dr Somashekhar SP, chairman & HoD Surgical Oncology-MHEPL, Bengaluru, says, “Resident doctors are the first line of physicians who are directly involved in the treatment of the patients. It is their well-being and peace of mind that is going to determine the efficiency of the institute. But sadly, that peace of mind is never achieved even though it is the bare minimum that should be provided to them. Long working hours that are uncapped, not even getting a proper residence with basic amenities or their salaries on time are just a few examples that each resident goes through. On many occasions, they do chores that are not dignified at their level. After such hurdles, how can we expect our resident doctors to have a healthy mind?” Dr Somashekhar adds further that while many of them need help for their mental health, yet due to the constant stigma surrounding it and the fear of their peers and seniors they refuse to seek help when it is of utmost importance. “When things get out of hand, they might take grave steps that are simply beyond repair,” he says. Dr Shivarama Varambally, professor of Psychiatry, NIMHANS, Bengaluru, has a similar story to tell. “In certain specialties such as neurosurgery and anaesthesia, the long duty hours often take a toll on students’ psyche, unlike in the West where there is a clear cap of 48 hours per week. What often compounds the situation is the poor pay of PG students. In government owned medical colleges, they may earn Rs 70,000 per month for the first year, but in private colleges, there is no fixed pay scale. The PG students also do not have vacations, and there is no surety that they will be granted leaves as and when required. However, since the number of PG seats have gone up in recent years, there is a possibility that the situation might improve,"" Dr Varambally says. As per a National Mental Health survey, one in every five PG medical students suffer some form of mental health illness which explains the need for dedicated mental health professionals and counselling units in medical colleges, much like the technical institutes such as the IITs where it is a given. “Yoga can be one of the healing solutions, in addition to setting up adequate sports facilities in all the medical colleges to give the resident doctors an opportunity to bust stress,” Dr Varambally adds. According to him, many of the resident doctors battle anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress since they see patients dying daily. “It is important to tell them that it is normal to feel that way. Professional help should be provided to the PG students specially in their first year when they have left home to pursue medical studies and living in hostels,” he says. Highlighting students’ plight, Dr Anshita Mishra, postgraduate first year medical student, Maulana Azad Medical College, New Delhi, explains, “The PG students are assigned no specific job roles but they are held accountable for every mistake that takes place. We are told that being doctors we cannot ask for leave nor even a good night’s sleep, but how can we be expected to work with full dedication when our brains do not relax completely.” She elaborates, “I know of colleges where the PGs are expected to work in OPD even on Sundays. We are eligible to take leaves as per the guidelines of respective universities but some of us are unable to avail them because of the lack of a conducive environment.

It has called for standard operating procedures (SOP) to manage in case any such incident occurs in future. A five-member team of the party conducted inquiries with family members of the girl, villagers, school administration and police personnel. It concluded that the lapses on the part of the district administration and police led to large-scale violence in the district. The 21-page report of the team was released by CPM state secretary K Balakrishnan in Chennai on Wednesday. “Both the district administration and police department did not take substantive measures for four days after the girl’s death. This is why violence erupted on the school campus on July 17,” U Vasuki of the All India Democratic Women’s Association said. She said the school correspondent, Ravikumar, has links with the BJP and right-wing organisations. “It seems he tried to obstruct the investigation into the death of the girl,” she said. The team found that details provided by the school management and postmortem report were contradictory. The fact-finding team’s report pinpointed that there were discrepancies, one of which related to the injuries sustained by the girl before death. Police failed to follow due procedure in handling the case, the report said. They raised doubts in the first postmortem report. They called for action on the resident medical officer and tutor of the Kallakurichi Medical College and Kallakurichi DSP for failing to conduct the first post-mortem properly. Following the violence on the school campus, police made indiscriminate arrests of many youth and teenagers who were not involved in the riots. They were not even present in the locality when the incidents happened, the report said.

99,NEW DELHI,['16-year-old'],How Delhi schools are trying to curb bullying,"NEW DELHI: Including student representatives in school committees that address bullying, placing boxes around schools to help children submit complaints, allotting separate break timings for the junior and senior students and increasing access of children to counsellors are some steps city institutions are working on to ensure safer campuses for youngsters. Following the suicide of a 16-year-old boy in Faridabad after allegedly suffering prolonged bullying in school, Delhi principals say now it is imperative for institutions to sternly follow the guidelines on the offence. Suruchi Gandhi, principal, Bal Bharti School, Dwarka, said, “There are defined rules and guidelines on how to deal with bullying. The anti-bullying committee and POSCO committee includes counsellors, principals and external members. I have a student representative also on the committee. The panels hold regular meetings and all teachers are asked to report any misdemeanour to the committees. In case of complaints, an investigation team follows up the case without revealing the identity of the student involved.” The Indian School too has a student member in its anti-bullying committee. “Peers discouraging bullying makes a bigger impact on students,” said Tania Joshi, school principal. “Bullying is something that can happen at any level and the biggest weapon in our hands is the children talking to each other about it. We have put up boxes across the school into which any student can drop a chit anonymously. Complaints are not just about bullying in the school but outside it as well.” Teachers too need to be sensitised to the menace. As Gandhi pointed out, “Sometimes, teachers disclose the name of the students visiting the counsellor. Counsellors are sensitive to the issue, but the subject teachers don’t know how to deal with these situations. It is important that teachers develop connections so that the children can share things freely with them.” Most schools heads, however, are concerned about cyberbullying as this is much more complicated than physical bullying in schools. “Students are smart about technology and often don’t own up to mischief. We often threaten them by telling them we will consult the police cyber cell. They must know that action will be taken for online offences,” said Joshi. Ashok Pandey, director, Ahlcon Schools, said in the current situation developing social-emotional skills in students was crucial for educational institutions. “Socio-emotional skills include self-awareness and social management. Cognitive learning is important, but this must be complemented by socio-emotional learning. If you are not emotionally mature, how will you be able to focus on cognition?” said Pandey.

100,KOTA,[],"Kota admin, coaching institutes hold meeting to check suicides","KOTA: Concerned over incidents of suicides by coaching students in recent months in Kota, the district administration on Wednesday conveyed a meeting with officials and representatives of coaching institutes and hostels and discussed ways to check it and to render mental, emotional support and security to students coming from across the country to Kota for preparation for entrance exams for admission in medical and engineering colleges. At the meeting presided over by Kota collector Om Prakesh Bunker, the officials and representatives of coaching institutes and hostels were made aware of their respective responsibility towards coaching students and were warned of serious action if any recklessness was committed. It was also noted that lease holders of hostels would also hold the same responsibility as those of owners of hostels. The meeting was aimed at taking suggestions to check the incidents of suicide by coaching students, said Bunker while speaking to media after the meeting. In some cases of suicides, it was found that there were no proper arrangements for counselors, nor institutes could pay attention to them (students) and failed to inform their parents on time that led to tragedies, he added. To check such incidents in future, it was decided that officials from district administration would be deputed as in-charge in some of the institutes to carry out regular monitoring and to recommend for improvement in case of lapses and loopholes in the institute, he said. “Kota is an education city and incidents of suicide is a blot,” said Kota city SP Kesar Singh Shekhawat and added any negligence by coaching institute or hostel would be taken seriously. A plan was chalked out at the meeting that aimed at complete check over the incidents of suicides by coaching students, he added.

Kolkata saw a 48.6% rise in suicides last year as compared to 2020. Overall, the state witnessed 13,500 suicides in 2021, of which 4,644 involved the family or relationship issues — almost 34% of all suicide cases. Bengal came fourth in terms of absolute cases of suicides next to Maharashtra (22,207), Tamil Nadu (18,925) and Madhya Pradesh (14,965). The report also shows that men outnumbered women in killing themselves — 8,290 men and 5,209 women died by suicide in 2021. This was a 3% jump in the number of suicides from 2020 when the state had registered 13,103 cases. Going by the NCRB report, 850 people died by suicide over marital issues while 176 others killed themselves due to dowry issues, 2,704 over family issues and 769 over setbacks suffered in love affairs. The city had witnessed a 54% rise in suicides during Covid-hit 2020. From 278 suicides in 2020, the city cops recorded 413 suicides in 2021. In Kolkata, total 140 victims ended their lives due to mental illness. At Asansol, suicide cases rose from 329 in 2020 to 477 last year, a rise of 45%. Around 10,351 victims used to earn less than Rs 1 lakh while 2,190 victims’ earnings ranged between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh. The 459 others earned between Rs 5-10 lakh and another 499 earned more than Rs 10 lakh a year. Among the suicide victims last year, 1,998 were homemakers and another 2,013 were either daily labourers or self-employed. The 806 other victims were engaged in business or trade while 401 worked in private sector and 267 in government sector. Of the suicide victims, 272 were students. Psychiatrists and psychologists, along with sociologists, warned that it would be inaccurate to attribute specific causes that led to the decisions taken by the victims. It is often an amalgamation of several issues and the specific state of mind of the victim, said one of them. “Never the less, it gives certain indicators that can be used to combat suicides,” said an officer. While biological, psychological and sociological reasons were responsible for mental vulnerabilities, people in India were wrongly conditioned to believe they should never admit their fragility, felt counsellors. “It drives many to die by suicide without any apparent warning,” said psychological counsellor Soumya Mukherjee. There is never a single reason behind a suicide, said psychiatrist J Ram.

""Let the administration realise our issues matter; students' mental health matters,"" read an e-pamphlet widely circulated on social media declaring September 9 as 'silent day'. ""The power of students is stronger than those in power,"" it stated. Later, speaking to TOI, some students alleged that they were facing tremendous academic pressure on campus, made worse by the lack of support from the staff and absolutely no recreational activities. They claimed that many students were battling mental health issues because of it. .In response to a questionnaire sent by TOI, IIT-H maintained that it has been ""trying its best to support students who are having academic difficulties"".  The faculty advisors are constantly in touch with students, particularly those who are not doing very well,"" an statement released by the institute read. Students, however, said there are many problems on campus along with the pressure of studies - poor hostel, food, water facilities. ""Many students complain of not getting support from their guides. On top of that, we are never sanctioned funds for recreational activities. As a result, students rarely get to organise events to unwind,"" said a student. The last event was held in March this year. This claim too was refuted by the IIT management. ""Recreational activities are organised by students, typically during the semester and not during vacations... The students have already planned for 'Milan' (an inter-hostel competition) from this weekend. In addition, the Dean (students) has already allocated funds for various cultural activities within each hostel and this has been informed to students quite some time back,"" the statement added. And while the management stated it was ""shocked at the recent unfortunate incidents"", some students complained of high handedness by institute officials, while dealing with student suicides. ""During an internal meeting held recently, the officials tried to wash their hands off the suicides by saying that both the students had personal issues. But the reality is that they were stressed because of academics and other college-related issues,"" said a B Tech student on condition of anonymity. According to him Megh Kapoor - the 22-year-old who jumped from the third floor of a lodge on September 7 - had been attending classes but was asked to vacate the hostel as he had completed four years on campus. He had six backlogs. ""As per IIT rule, nobody can stay on campus once they finish the four-year duration. But while Megh was asked to leave, two others were allowed to stay in the hostel,"" claimed another student. According to him, Megh had been writing e-mails to the authorities for a month expressing his concerns. ""He repeatedly told them that he was finding it very difficult to stay outside the campus, but nobody paid heed to it,"" the student added. In the case of B Rahul, students alleged that the college failed to support his thesis. The MTech second year student was found dead inside his hostel room last month. ""He felt his thesis was undoable because he didn't get the required support from the institute,"" alleged a student claiming that Rahul had even typed this out on his laptop.

This made the girl feel ashamed and insulted, and she jumped into a waterbody to end her life, but was saved. The girl is under treatment and still in shock after the incident. Inconsolable, she said that she studies in Class 9th of Swami Atmanand School in Kansabel region of Jashpur district and on Friday while she was in examination hall, she carried a mobile phone inside, which was prohibited. The girl said that she took the phone to school because she lives far away and needs a phone for her safety, but she didn’t have any explanation for taking the phone inside the exam hall. When a female teacher was alerted that the girl had a phone, the teacher allegedly asked her obscene questions about where she had hidden it and then upon finding it, she read out the personal messages in front of those present, the girl said in her statement, a video of which was accessed by TOI. Moreover, when the complaint was taken up to the principal, her parents were called and the messages on her phone were read out again in front of her father, teachers and principal to shame her. Her chats were shown to her father which infuriated him and he slapped the minor. Instead of counseling the girl, the whole event made her feel so insulted that the distressed girl didn’t go home, rather, she jumped in the Maini river. With a shepherd’s alertness and help, she was somehow saved and shifted to hospital. No action has been taken in the matter yet and police said that the girl is undergoing treatment. The school principal accepted it was the teachers' mistake to publicly shame her by reading out personal messages which might have affected the girl’s psyche. He said that students are not allowed to bring mobile phones and two-wheelers to the school and students should abide by the rule. Many such cases go unreported and such incidents leave a negative impact in the minds of students, often turning life threatening or scarring children for life. When contacted, state School Education secretary S Bharathidasan said, “Training programme modules are being prepared for teachers towards addressing such issues and the modules also incorporate basic disciplines.

She was staying alone.” They conducted a search in her room, but did not find a suicide note, he added. “We have given information of the incident to her mother, who is on her way to Pune. We have sent the victim’s body to Sassoon General Hospital for a postmortem and a report is awaited,” Karpe added. For now, they have registered the incident as an accidental death and will be recording statements of the students and others as part of their investigations to establish the cause of her death, he added. The cinematography student, a resident of Goa, was also found hanging in his room. The police could not find any note from his room either. Rabeehashmi had said that he was a student of the 2017 batch of the cinematography course. Security officers from the FTII called up the police after they received reports that he was not opening the room despite repeated knocks, and the room was locked from the inside. When the police arrived and opened the door, they ascertained that he may have died some days ago.

The advocates said that the state was not even made a party in the case. However, the state government's fervent plea did not convince the court to stay the HC order.

While seven died by suicide on Tuesday, three killed themselves on Wednesday. In South Bopal, a man who was in financial distress consumed poison. On getting to know of his son’s death, his father hanged himself. While the year 2020 was the ‘year of pandemic’ for India and Gujarat, experts term 2021 as the ‘year of despair’. The country, including Gujarat, saw the peak of the pandemic, a large population also started experiencing the long-term effects of Covid-19 in areas ranging from interpersonal relationships to financial stability. This has translated into a higher number of suicides, revealed statistics by the city police. According to figures, the city recorded suicides of 542 persons between January and August in 2020. In the same period, 687 people ended their lives this year. To put the figure in perspective, 763 suicides were recorded in the entire year of 2019, whereas the figure was 808 in 2020. This means that on an average, 3 (2.8) people died by suicide daily in the city. Analysis of the figures reveal that the rise in male suicide was 34% compared to 10% in female suicide. The overall rise was about 30%, said senior city police officials. It’s not just the police figures that reflect this rise. The Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Services figures reveal that from January to August this year, they recorded the deaths of 106 persons and rescued 24 persons. In comparison, they recorded the deaths of 113 persons and the rescue of 29 in the entire year of 2020. This begs the question: what is pushing citizens to the brink? Dr Ajay Chauhan, medical superintendent of the Hospital for Mental Health (HMH), said that four out of every 10 persons in OPDs this year complain of depression and stress. “Many of these patients admitted to having suicidal thoughts. As this year’s theme proclaims, the need of the hour is creating hope through action. We need to reach out to these persons in need by identifying signs early and assuring them that they can talk about their issues and that there are other ways to deal with it,” said Dr Chauhan. Pravin Valera, coordinator of Jeevan Aastha helpline, said that compared to 14,000 calls between January and August last year, this year’s tally has already reached 19,000 – a rise of about 36%. “The pattern of calls has changed, too. Last year, we fielded a lot of distress calls from students worried about their studies and future. But this year around, a large chunk of calls are about monetary issues, loss of job, loss of loved ones and depression caused by interpersonal relationships,” said Valera. “The message of this day is never to lose hope and find the brighter side.” ",10-09-2021,"['died', 'suicide', 'killed', 'distress', 'poison', 'death', 'despair', 'died', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'complain', 'depression', 'stress', 'suicidal', 'issues', 'distress', 'worried', 'issues', 'loss', 'loss', 'depression', 'lose']"

146,BHOPAL,['12-year-old'],Bhopal: Students’ suicides declined this year,"BHOPAL: According to police data, there has been a decline in student suicide cases this year, compared to previous years. In 2019, 48 cases of student suicides were reported, including 23 male and 25 female students. It grew around 15 percent in 2020 in which 53 student suicide cases were reported, including 31 male and 22 female students. This year almost no suicide cases were caused by failure in exams. Although a number of minor children’s suicides were reported wherein major cause was found to be addiction to smartphone or online gaming. In such a case reported on September 8, a 12-year-old girl committed suicide by hanging herself at her home in Kolar. Neighbours told police that the girl's family members had scolded her for using smartphone too much, after which she took the extreme step. Speaking on the issue, consultant psychiatrist Satyakant Trivedi said, usually student suicides were attributed to failure in exams or securing less percentage. Lockdown and Corona curfew gave them an opportunity to spend time with their family under supervision. This helped in increasing family bonding, they were also saved from exposure to drug addiction. Dr Trivedi said , parents should teach their children to manage stress properly. They should avoid instant gratification. Nowadays parents are too protective, so children are not used to handling stress, adversities or trauma. So once the children are exposed to stress, they take impulsive steps. Mental disorders are increasing, but they are under-diagnosed and untreated. Sometimes there is unrecognised, untreated depression or petty issue that triggers extreme step.

147,KOCHI,[],Kerala: Law student ends life over domestic violence,"KOCHI: Law student Mofiya Parveen (21), allegedly committed suicide in Aluva over the domestic violence she suffered at her husband’s home. The Edayapuram resident was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her home on Monday night. A suicide note recovered from her room said that she had to endure mental torture from her husband, Suhail, and his family. The note also alleged denial of justice and sought action against inspector CL Sudheer of Aluva East police station where she had filed a complaint against Suhail. Her family alleged that he verbally abused Mofiya in front of her husband and father when they were called to the station in connection with the domestic violence complaint she had filed a month ago. “Pappa, sorry. Please forgive me. You were right. He is not a genuine person. He portrayed me as a mentally-ill person. I can’t bear this pain anymore. Pappa, my soul will be here. Suhail and his parents are criminals. Action must be taken against them and the CI. This is my final wish,” she wrote. District police chief (Ernakulam Rural) K Karthick removed Sudheer from the post of Aluva East SHO. He was the investigation officer in Uthra murder case and was transferred to Aluva as a punishment for his unprofessional behaviour during investigation. A probe was launched under the direct supervision of Aluva deputy SP; police registered a case for suicide abetment against Suhail and family. Sources said Mofiya and Suhail got acquainted on Facebook and married in April this year. Her family alleged that Suhail, who convinced them that he was working in the Middle East, said that he did not want dowry. Two months after their marriage, Suhail and his parents allegedly started harassing her in the name of dowry. Her father Dilshad K Salim alleged that Suhail even asked him to pay Rs 40 lakhs as he wanted to produce a film. As he did not agree, Suhail harassment rose. “He tarnished Mofiya’s image in front of her relatives saying that she had mental issues. As the situation worsened, Mofiya filed a domestic violence complaint with the district police chief a month ago that was redirected to Aluva deputy SP office. A few days later I received a call from Alangad police,” Salim said. He alleged that police did not take action until Monday morning, when Sudheer asked Mofiya and her father to give their statements. But it turned into a ‘compromise’ talk as Suhail and his parents too came. Police hadn’t even registered a case based on her complaint. “During discussion, the inspector verbally abused me and Mofiya. He asked me how much dowry I had given to Suhail. When she saw Suhail and her parents, she asked why they were here and the inspector continued harassing us,” Salim said, adding that his daughter was opposed to dowry. Salim said the incident shook her and she locked herself in her room after returning home. As she did not respond to their knocks on the door, they looked through the window and found her hanging. Women’s commission too sought an explanation from Aluva deputy SP as Mofiya had approached it earlier. Youth Congress held a protest march to Aluva police station. The march turned violent and police had to use water cannons to disperse protesters.

The scheme for class 1 to 12 students has been on at irregular intervals since 2010. The death has to be certified by a civil surgeon and the beneficiary of the ex gratia will be the mother. In case the mother has passed away, the father gets the one-time payment. If both parents are deceased, the money goes to an adult sibling (18 years and above). Permanent disability, on the other hand, includes two organs and two eyes, and here, too, the disability has to be certified by a civil surgeon. The ex gratia for partial permanent disability (one organ, one eye) has been raised from Rs 30,000 to Rs 75,000. The final decision on claims will be made by a committee after verifying relevant documents. State education officials said the response to the scheme has been poor due to lack of awareness.

The law student Mofiya Parveen (21) had allegedly taken her life due to domestic violence and dowry-related harassment about which she had complained to the police. Ernakulam rural police probing the alleged suicide had arrested her husband and his parents on Wednesday. CL Sudheer who was the inspector of Aluva East police station where she had filed a complaint in this regard was transferred out from the position on Wednesday and was posted to police headquarters.

The Edayapuram resident was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her home on Monday night. A suicide note recovered from her room said that she had to endure mental torture from her husband, Suhail, and his family. The note also alleged denial of justice and sought action against the inspector. Mofiya's husband Muhammed Suhail (27) of Maleykudy House, Kuttilanji, Eramalloor and his parents Rukhya (55) and Yousuf (63) were arrested and remanded in judicial custody. The case, which was initially registered as a case for unnatural death was altered and sections 304B (dowry death), 498A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 306 (abetment of suicide) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC were added. Mofiya and Suhail had got acquainted on Facebook and married in April this year. Her family had alleged that Suhail, who convinced them that he was working in the Middle-east, had said that he did not want dowry. Two months after their marriage, Suhail and his parents allegedly started harassing her in the name of dowry, sources said.

It also suspended the execution of their sentences awarded by a special CBI court in December 2020 till the disposal of appeals filed.  A bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and C Jayachandran granted them bail subject to a bond of Rs 5 lakh each based on their application.

Aluva town witnessed violence for over three hours and police had to use force to disperse protesters who tried to enter the premises of district police chief’s (Ernakulam Rural) office around 11am. Meanwhile, a special investigation team, led by deputy SP V Rajeev from Ernakulam Rural district crime branch, will investigate Mofiya’s case. The protesters, led by DCC president Mohammed Shiyas, were stopped by using barricades a few 100m away from the chief’s office by the police. At the same time, a sit-in- protest, attended by MPs Hibi Eden and Benny Behanan and MLAs Anwar Sadat, Roji M John and Eldhose Kunnappilly, was launched in front of Aluva East police station. Mofiya’s parents met the leaders. But, the protest turned violent when party workers hurled stones, eggs and wooden pieces at the police. More than 200 policemen, who were deployed there, retaliated with lathicharge, teargas shells and water cannons multiple times. Though the protest was called off by 1.30pm after consultation with opposition leader VD Satheesan and KPCC president K Sudhakaran, Behanan said that they will not stop until the officer is dismissed and arrested. Sudhakaran, who criticized the government for ‘honouring’ the inspector by transferring him to the police headquarters, said the fight for truth and justice cannot be stopped by police force. He said that the 11,124 cases registered for atrocities against women this year showed women were unsafe under Pinarayi’s government. Police also took 20-odd students of Al-Azhar Law College, Thodupuzha –where Mofiya studied–into custody for protesting at the SP office. Ajmal Hakeem Pattery, a student, said the police acted without provocation. Meanwhile, Ernakulam DIG Neeraj Kumar Gupta, who conducted an enquiry in the way the case was handled initially, will submit a report to the state police chief soon. Though he kept mum, it is learnt that the enquiry found severe lapses on the part of inspector Sudheer as he registered a case of domestic violence only after Mofiya’s death though the complaint was filed 25 days ago. But, Congress leaders alleged that the report did not mention anything about the unprofessional behaviour of the policeman. Meanwhile, Aluva FCJM court remanded Mofiya’s husband Mohammed Suhail and in-laws Rukhya and Yousuf (who were arrested on Wednesday) into judicial custody for 14 days.

It is shocking to know that the person who motivated stressed students chose to leave the world like this, said a former student, putting into words what the others felt. Since the early 1990s, Vyas was associated with the Sardar Patel Institute of Public Administration (SPIPA) after it set up an IAS training centre. He taught Gujarati language and literature to hundreds of Gujarat Public Service Commission and Union Public Service Commission aspirants. He also taught IAS and IPS officers from other states who were appointed in Gujarat to master the language. “Prof Vyas was a very sensitive and loving person. While teaching us, he just didn’t teach language and literature but aimed to motivate us. There were students who were suffering from depression in my batch due to pressure of studies. He motivated them to deal with stress and depression. Today, they have become government officers who can successfully deal with much more pressure than what they faced during their studies. It is shocking to know that the person who motivated these students chose to leave the world like this,” said Rakesh Vyas, additional collector, department of women and child welfare (nutrition), Gandhinagar. He added, “Prof Vyas trained many senior officers from states like UP and Bihar who were appointed to Gujarat and had to learn the local language to ensure better administration. I personally know many officers who know Gujarati now because of Professor Vyas’s training.” The additional collector said that the professor also lent financial help to many UPSC and GPSC aspirants who came from poor families. “His sudden demise has left a vacuum in Gujarati linguistic research,” he added.

Vismaya, an Ayurveda medical student, hanged herself in her marital home in June last year. ""Additional district and sessions judge-1 Sujith K N also sentenced S Kiran Kumar to six years and two years imprisonment for the offences of abetment to suicide and dowry harrasment under the IPC,"" said special public prosecutor G Mohanraj. Kumar was also sentenced to six years for the offence of taking dowry and one year for demanding dowry under the Dowry Prohibition Act. ""The court said the sentences would run concurrently,"" said the SPP after the sentence was pronounced. A total fine of Rs 12,55,000 was also imposed on Kumar, he said adding that out of that Rs 2 lakh has been directed to be paid to the parents of the victim. The SPP said he was satisfied with the sentence awarded to the convict. However, the victim's mother, who appeared disheartened, said she was not happy with the outcome as she had expected the convict would get life term. Addressing media at her residence, she said the family would appeal against the sentencing and that she does not believe her daughter got justice. She also said that they would be continuing their efforts for action against the others who were allegedly responsible for Vismaya's suicide. Vismaya's father, on the other hand, told reporters outside the court that he was happy with the punishment given to Kumar. He said he as well as his daughter have got justice and that the punishment was also a message to society. He also said he had not expected that life term would be given to Kumar. Whether to appeal or not would be decided after discussing it with the SPP. The court order came after hearing arguments on behalf of the prosecution and the convict on the quantum of sentence. Special public prosecutor (SPP) G Mohanraj, in his arguments, sought the maximum possible punishment for the convict so that it acts as a deterrent in society. The convict's lawyers sought a compassionate view from the court claiming that he is the sole earner in the family and that his parents were suffering from various ailments. Earlier in the day, Vismaya's father left for court in the car which was given as dowry. He told scribes outside his home that his daughter loved the car and he believes her soul is there with him in the vehicle. The court on Monday had convicted Kumar for the offences of dowry death (section 304B), abetment of suicide (section 306) and dowry related harassment (section 498A) under the IPC and various provisions of the Dowry Prohibition Act. The offence of dowry death under section 304B of IPC carries a minimum sentence of seven years and a maximum of life imprisonment. The offences of dowry harassment under Section 498A of IPC and abetment to suicide under Section 306 of IPC carry a maximum punishment of three years and 10 years jail term, respectively. Kumar, who was an assistant motor vehicle inspector, was dismissed from service after his arrest in the case and state Transport Minister Antony Raju on Monday had said that there will be no change in that irrespective of whether the court convicts him or not. However, with his conviction, the bail granted to him by the Supreme Court was automatically rescinded and the police had taken him into custody from the court. The court had on May 17 reserved its verdict in the case. Kerala Police in its over 500-page charge sheet had said that Vismaya committed suicide due to dowry harassment. Vismaya, 22, was found dead in the house of her husband at Sasthamkotta in Kollam district on June 21, 2021. A day before the incident, Vismaya had sent WhatsApp messages to her relatives over the alleged harassment by Kumar over dowry, as well as photos of wounds and marks of beatings on her body. Her father had said that 100 sovereigns of gold (one sovereign is equal to 8 grams gold) and over one acre land, besides a car worth Rs 10 lakh was given as dowry to Kumar during the wedding in 2020. But Kumar did not like the car and wanted Rs 10 lakh in cash. As he was told it was not possible, he used to torture her, the father had said.

Mohanty, a Plus-III first-year history student, allegedly hanged herself to death in her hostel room on Saturday. Though Mohanty blamed three of her seniors for her death in her purported suicide note, she did not name anyone. The Badagada police is yet to unravel the mystery surrounding the three unknown seniors, who allegedly abetted her suicide. ""We do not have any faith in the commissionerate police. It seems the police are trying to shield the culprits. Only the CBI can solve the case. Though ragging incidents have been occurring frequently, the government is yet to curb the menace,"" senior BJP MLA and opposition chief whip in the assembly Mohan Majhi said. Congress MLA Suresh Rautray, too, said the police have failed to make any headway in the investigation. ""As per the National Crime Records Bureau, 1,469 students committed suicide in Odisha in 2020, second after Maharashtra with 1,648 such cases. The state police have failed to give justice to many students, who ended their own lives,"" Rautray alleged. The convener of a social forum has urged chief minister Naveen Patnaik to bring a legislation against ragging after a Plus III student of BJB College, Ruchika Mohanty, allegedly committed suicide on Saturday due to suspected ragging by her seniors. ""Nobody knows that there is ragging incident happening in my college, but my seniors did not let me live. I give my life for those three of my seniors. They pushed me into depression and did not let me continue to study. I could not even tell my problems to my roommates. Finally, I quit,"" Ruchika's purported suicide note read. Tejeswar Parida, convener of Ragging Free Campus Abhiyan, said the state government should take the ragging cases seriously. ""Several ragging cases are coming up in the state. The government should open a helpline number for students in distress because of ragging,"" he added. College principal Niranjan Mishra said he got information about the incident at around 10.30am. ""I immediately called the local police over the phone and reached the hostel. After discussing with the police, we broke open the door of her hostel room. We found her lying on the bed in the room facing downward. Police found a plastic rope while turning her body,"" he said. Police have recorded statements of Ruchika's friends. ""She was an introvert person. She was not talking to others except her roommates. Her room was on the third floor, but she was staying with her friends in 201 most of the time. She had joined a coaching institute recently and was preparing for UPSC examinations,"" said the principal. History was Ruchika's honours subject in Plus-III first year (arts stream). She did not attend her classes on Saturday. Before her friends left the room for classes at 10 am, she had requested them to share the notes with her. On April 22, first year MBBS student Nishant Kumar of Bhima Bhoi Medical College and Hospital at Balangir had allegedly committed suicide by jumping off the hostel building.

She said that the incident shows that the anti-women attitude prevailing in the society was affecting the police machinery as well. “Women should be able to go to police stations and lodge complaints without any fear. Actually, police should adopt a stand of taking the complaint of a woman at face value. But often what happens at police stations are a trial,” she said.

195,NEW DELHI,[],Reprimanding student for indiscipline does not amount to abetment of suicide: SC,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled that a teacher reprimanding students for indiscipline or bunking of classes would not amount to abetment of suicide if an emotional and sentimental student takes the extreme step after being admonished as it is a solemn duty of a teacher to instill discipline in the pupils. A bench of Justices S Abdul Nazeer and Krishna Murari quashed the criminal proceedings against a teacher of a private school who was booked for abatement of suicide after a class IX student committed suicide after being caught for bunking classes. FIR was filed against the teacher as he had reprimanded the student who also named him in the suicide note. The bench, however, after examining the note, said a reading of it suggests the hypersensitive temperament of the deceased which led him to take such an extraordinary step and which would not ordinarily induce a similarly circumstanced student to commit suicide. ""It is a solemn duty of a teacher to instill discipline in the students. It is not uncommon that teachers reprimand a student for not being attentive or not being up to the mark in studies or for bunking classes or not attending school. The disciplinary measures adopted by a teacher or other authorities of a school, reprimanding a student for his indiscipline, in our considered opinion, would not be tantamount to provoking a student to commit suicide unless there are repeated specific allegations of harassment and insult deliberately without any justifiable cause or reason,"" Justice Murari, who penned the judgment. said. The court said a simple act of reprimand of a student for his behaviour or indiscipline by a teacher, who is under moral obligations to inculcate the good qualities of a human being in a student would definitely not amount to instigation or intentionally aid to the commission of suicide by a student. ""If, a student is simply reprimanded by a teacher for an act of indiscipline and bringing the continued act of indiscipline to the notice of Principal of the institution who conveyed to the parents of the student for school discipline and correcting a child, any student who is very emotional or sentimental commits suicide, can the said teacher be held liable for the same and charged and tried for the offence of abetment of suicide under section 306 IPC. Our answer to the said question is 'No',"" the bench said. ""‘Spare the rod and spoil the child’ an old saying may have lost its relevance in present days and Corporal punishment to the child is not recognised by law but that does not mean that a teacher or school authorities have to shut their eyes to any indiscipline act of a student. It is not only the moral duty of a teacher but one of the legally assigned duties under Section 24 (e) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 to hold regular meetings with the parents and guardians and apprise them about the regularity in attendance...,"" the court said. It said there must be an allegation of either direct or indirect act of incitement to the commission of the offence of suicide and mere allegations of harassment of the deceased by another person would not be sufficient in itself, unless, there are allegations of such actions on the part of the accused which compelled the commission of suicide. ""Further, if the person committing suicide is hypersensitive and the allegations attributed to the accused is otherwise not ordinarily expected to induce a similarly situated person to take the extreme step of committing suicide, it would be unsafe to hold the accused guilty of abetment of suicide. Thus, what is required is an examination of every case on its facts and circumstances and keeping in consideration the surrounding circumstances as well, which may have bearing on the alleged action of the accused and the psyche of the deceased,"" the bench said.

In her suicide note, Ruchika blamed three seniors for her death but did not name anyone.“We took the help of the psychologist to assist us in the investigation.

We can read their minds and help them get rid of their trauma. In the presence of the police, I tried to make the students feel comfortable and urged them to supply the police with information,” Pradhan said.Ruchika’s parents Ganeswar Mohanty and Bidulata Mohanty continue to sit on dharna outside BJB College since her death, demanding immediate arrest of the three who allegedly abetted her suicide. They have been demanding a CBI probe into the circumstances that prompted her to kill herself.“Over a week has passed since my daughter died, but the police are yet to identify the three seniors.

198,VIJAYAWADA,[],Court orders fresh probe into death of tribal medical student,"VIJAYAWADA: The high court has ordered a fresh investigation into the suspicious death of a tribal medical student. The high court expressed displeasure over the investigation of the police and inordinate delay in obtaining forensic lab report on mobile phone data analysis. Directing the director general of police (DGP) to appoint a deputy superintendent of police (DSP) rank officer who is specialised in investigation, the high court asked that the investigation be completed in six months. One Gugulot Varalakshmi moved the high court in 2021, seeking a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the death of her son Pushpak Naik, who was found dead under suspicious circumstances in 2019. Pushpak Naik was studying MBBS at Alluri Sita Ramaraju Institute of Medical Sciences in Eluru. Police concluded the case to be one of suicide by hanging. However, Pushpak’s parents raised doubts on the investigation and gave representations to the police with specific allegations. Pushpak’s parents alleged that he was harassed by senior students in the name of caste. They also raised doubts over things lying in disarray in his room the day he was found dead. As the police did not look into the specific issues, Varalakshmi moved the high court, seeking a CBI inquiry. While the police contended that they concluded the case as death due to hanging and are awaiting for the forensic lab report of the mobile phone, the CBI filed an affidavit stating that the case is not fit for their investigation in view of their case load. Considering the arguments on all sides, Justice D V S S Somayajulu observed that the police investigation did not answer the specific allegations levelled by the parents.

Rahul, a student of Army Public School (Parachute Regiment Training Centre) in JC Nagar and younger son of Bhagat Singh from RT Nagar, shot himself in the head using his father’s licensed pistol at a bus shelter behind IAF training centre on Sanjaynagar Main Road early Friday morning. A CCTV footage had shown Rahul checking his cellphone while walking towards the bus shelter. This had led cops to think he might have been sending some messages. However, now police have found that Rahul hadn’t sent any messages. Instead, he deleted many WhatssApp messages, photos and videos before entering the bus shelter. “Rahul’s father Bhagat Singh told us that Rahul had been quieter than usual for a couple of days and was interacting little with friends and others. Around 2am Friday, he woke up his mother, asking for a picture of her and his elder sister. She convinced him saying he could get them in the morning. These actions indicate he was upset. But we are yet to find reason behind the same,” said an investigating officer.

While altogether 142 people had committed suicide in the capital city between January and June last year, 151 people ended their lives here during the same period this year. The 151 deceased included 38 people, who died by suicide during the lockdown in May (16 suicides) and June (22 suicides) this year. The suicide figures of the lockdown in May and June 2020 stood at 49 (18 in May and 31 in June). Police said overall suicide cases went up in Bhubaneswar in 2020 compared to 2019. While 220 persons had committed suicides in 2019, the figure rose to 310 in 2020. “Though suicide cases have not increased during the lockdown this year compared to the first wave, the pandemic’s impact on the minds of people has not subsided. In most cases, the deceased suffered from deep stress and ended their lives,” a senior police officer said. Most of the victims were in their 30s and 40s. “They were not highly educated. A few of them had to end their lives due to job loss and poor financial conditions. They either consumed poison or hanged themselves to death,” the officer said. Psychologists have been flooded with patients suffering from Covid-induced depression. “We found that the lockdown and the post-lockdown circumstances affected the middle-class people more than any other class. Closure of shops, malls and restaurants led to joblessness of many youths. Students have been in stress because of their uncertain future and career following closure of schools and coaching centres,” said S N Mishra, a retired psychology professor. Some experts said many people suffered from mental imbalance following negativity being spread through various sources of communication, media and social media. “Parents and other family members have greater roles to play to keep the youths and children happy.

According to the latest suicides data, the number of such deaths last year saw an increase of more than 21% compared to 2019. Analysis of data since 1995 shows that India lost more than 1.8 lakh students to suicides, of which the most were recorded in 2020, a year that had lesser examination pressure compared to any other year given that most students were promoted without exams. Of the 12,526 student suicides in 2020, nearly 53% or 6,598 were from just six states — Maharashtra, Odisha, MP, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Karnataka — while all other states and Union territories together reported 5,928 deaths. Analysing the trend over the years shows that between 1995 and 1999 student suicides accounted for more than 5.2% of all suicides on average. ‘Academic challenges could also be trigger’Data shows that between 1995 and 1999 student suicides accounted for over 5.2% of all suicides, with 1995 (6.6%) being the worst year; during 2000-2009, only one year saw student suicides making up for more than 5%. During 2010-2014, the last two years saw such cases make up more than 6% and every year thereafter has seen such cases account for more than 6%. While student suicides accounted for 7.4% of the 1.3 lakh total suicides in 2019, they account for 8.2% of the 1.5 lakh total suicides in 2020. Stressing the need for a detailed study, psychiatrists and experts TOI spoke to said that stress or anxiety that eventually led to deaths could have been triggered by a variety of issues, including Covid, unexpected changes in circumstances — social, economical and within the family — and academic challenges arising from new ways of learning. Dr John Vijay Sagar, professor and HoD, child and adolescent psychiatry, Nimhans, said: “Suicides don’t happen suddenly. In most of these cases, the students would have faced problems earlier too. The fact that the unprecedented circumstances the pandemic brought in would have meant they had to cope with additional stress and anxiety. Most children/students spent time at home by themselves, except in families where parents too could work from home. This means their coping mechanisms would have got affected with venting systems, like friends and school/college environment being absent.” He added that family conflicts that students would not have noticed would have come to the fore with everybody staying at home. Dr MS Dharmendra, consultant psychiatrist, Manasa Neuropsychiatric Hospital, said: “Students were restricted to homes because of the lockdown which caused a sudden change in their routines. Ability to cope with changes determines how they progressed in their studies as not everyone would be able to learn online.

Rathore said that Jain could not be identified immediately. Hence, police constituted different teams to help identify the deceased. This is the third incident of death by jumping inside the same mall.  In 2012, a 36-year-old woman jumped from the fourth floor of the mall and she died on the spot. Last year on December 25, a 20-year-old youth was killed after he fell from the third floor of the same mall. Police said that they spoke to the mall’s management and asked them to put up some safety nets inside the building to avert such incidents. “We had earlier proposed that they should place safety nets inside the mall. We have also asked them to increase the height of the barrier walls on each floor so that one cannot easily jump off it,” Rathore said. The Jhotwara police also retrieved CCTV footage of the incident wherein Jain could be seen arriving on the third floor from an escalator. He then runs and jumps over the glass wall. The customers and shopkeepers claimed that they heard a loud thud and then saw a youth lying motionless on the floor outside a retail outlet. Part of his face was disfigured in the incident which further impeded the identification process. Police said that Jain’s body will be handed over to the family after the post-mortem. “The reason behind his suicide needs to be ascertained. He was a college student and there could be multiple issues which need to be closely examined,” said an official.

234,AHMEDABAD,[],Four major Gujarat cities record 7% spike in suicides in Covid year,"AHMEDABAD: The Covid-19 pandemic year was marred by deaths due to disease. As people remained cooped inside the homes following lockdown and wide-scale restrictions in its aftermath, mental ill-health also took a toll. Four major cities of Gujarat — Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot — saw 150 more suicides between October, 2019, and September 2020, as per the data tabled in the Gujarat assembly. In fact, Vadodara recorded the highest jump of 22% where 269 persons ended their lives in the same period against 219 in 2018-19. Ahmedabad city saw a jump of 10% in suicides as 791 persons ended their lives. Across Gujarat, 7,508 persons committed suicide in 2019-20, three more than 7,505 persons who ended their lives in the same period in 2018-19. Of the total suicides, 2,288 took place in the four major cities. Ahmedabad also reported 331 attempted suicide cases, which were a five-year high, as compared to 218 attempts to end life recorded in 2015-16. More alarmingly, the city saw 29 students ending their lives between October 2019 and September 2020 as against as against 18 in 2018-19. This was also highest in past five years. Overall, 51 students ended their lives in the four major cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot during this period. Anju Sheth of Saath Suicide Helpline said lockdown adversely impacted mental health of people. “During and post-lockdown, there was an average 20-25% rise in mental disorders, depression, obsessive compulsive disorder cases, phobia and isolation. Many people battled severe financial crisis. Education and family life due to constant run-in with family members also led to mental discord. I feel the number of attempted suicides would be higher than reported as many do not report it fearing stigma,” said Sheth. She feared that the worst may not be over. “As third wave of coronavirus engulfs the state, uncertainty over jobs, education and health is far from over,” Sheth added. Pravin Valera of Jeevan Aastha helpline said they saw calls on the helpline double after Covid-19 struck. Women and children are worst affected. ""Students have experienced unprecedented uncertainty, anxiety and depression due to online education. Students also battle stress due to lack of smart phones for education and constantly staying at home under strict eye of parents and elders,"" said Valera. Valera says that the suicides of celebrities like actor Sushant Rajput Singh also led to copy-cat suicides.

235,BHUBANESWAR,[],Marginal rise in suicide cases in Bhubaneswar this year compared to 2020,"BHUBANESWAR: As Covid-19 pandemic triggered stress and psychological ailments among many, suicide cases recorded a marginal increase in Bhubaneswar in the first half of 2021 as compared to the corresponding period last year. While altogether 142 people died by suicide in the capital city between January and June 2020, 151 people ended their lives here during the same period this year. The 151 deceased included 38 people, who died by suicide during the lockdown in May (16 suicides) and June (22 suicides) this year. The suicide figures of the lockdown in May and June 2020 stood at 49 (18 in May and 31 in June). Police said overall suicide cases went up in Bhubaneswar in 2020 compared to 2019. While 220 people died by suicide in 2019, the figure rose to 310 in 2020. Though suicide cases have not increased during the lockdown this year compared to the first wave, the pandemic’s impact on the minds of people has not subsided. “In most cases, the deceased suffered from deep stress and ended their lives, a senior police officer said. Most of the victims were in their 30s and 40s. They were not highly educated. A few of them had to end their lives due to job loss and poor financial condition. They either consumed poison or hanged themselves to death,” the officer said. Psychologists have been flooded with patients suffering from Covid-induced depression. “We found that the lockdown and the post-lockdown circumstances affected the middle-class people more than any other class. Closure of shops, malls and restaurants led to joblessness of many youths. Students have been in stress because of their uncertain future and career following closure of schools and coaching centres,” said S N Mishra, a retired psychology professor. Some experts said many people suffered from mental imbalance following negativity being spread through various sources of communication, media and social media. “Parents and other family members have greater roles to play to keep the youths and children happy. We too have been counselling the depressed persons,” Mishra said. Recently the state prisons directorate asked all jails to arrange telepsychiatry sessions for inmates as many of them have developed mental illnesses owing to the uncertainty over the court trials of their cases and the temporary ban on physical meetings (mulaqat) with family members during the Covid-19 pandemic.

One of them was preparing for class 12 exams, while the other had just been promoted to class 12. The reasons are yet to be ascertained. Both did not leave behind any suicide note. The first incident happened at a posh residential layout in Bellandur, where the teen jumped from the terrace of his five-floor apartment complex at 12.30am. His acquaintances suspect he took the extreme step as he did not meet his expectations in the recent Joint Entrance Examination (JEE). ""The incident has come as a shocker to us. We do not know the reason, but we heard he was not happy with his JEE scores,"" said the school management. According to his friends, he left no hint about his plans. Around midnight, his parents realised the boy was missing from his room and he reportedly jumped from the terrace while they were searching for him. His body was taken to his hometown in Mangaluru. In the second incident, the student jumped from the balcony of his fifth-floor flat, again in Bellandur. ""He was a humanities student and is believed to have ended his life during an online class in the morning. He had reportedly spoken to his parents earlier about an angelic force driving him.

School conducts counselling sessionsThe school organised counselling sessions for the rest of the students. “Lack of face-to-face interactions has been a major setback. We have told students to reach out to us whenever they feel the need,” said the principal. Counsellors agree that lack of offline learning has affected the mental health of students. “The absence of direct interface with teachers, too much of learning through audio and video media and lack of socialising have impacted children. This is in addition to the already existing anxieties about exams, academic future and may be, even finances. With the pandemic, there is no mechanism to let out emotions and a lack of expression affects youngsters,” said Poorva Ranade, a psychologist. According to her, it’s important for parents to inculcate the thought among children that it’s OK to lose a year in case he/she is unable to cope. “Confusion, chaos and insecurity generated due to the pandemic are seeping in at all levels of society. The worry is also because we don’t know how long this will go on,” she added.

Her parents, who mortgaged their house for Rs 2 lakh and sought loans worth Rs 1.05 lakh from mahila mandal groups for their daughter’s education, alleged that the college’s order to vacate the hostel during the pandemic drove Arunima into taking the drastic step. “She knew we had put everything at stake to send her to Delhi for higher studies. She couldn’t seek more money from us as she was aware that we were struggling to pay back the loans. We had discontinued the education of our younger daughter to support her higher studies,” G Srinivas Reddy, the 19-year-old’s father, told TOI. Arunima’s parents also alleged that despite knowing that their daughter had no access to a laptop with internet service or a decent smartphone to attend online classes, she was asked to vacate the hostel. “I want the government to ensure that other students don’t face such problems,” said G Sumati Reddy, her mother. A case under CrPC Section 174 was registered at Shadnagar police station following a complaint filed by the father. Suman Sharma, LSR principal, said, “It is shocking news and we are in grief about what has occurred. The child never approached the hostel, scholarship committee or even the maths department for any assistance.” LSR Alumni Association on Sunday issued a statement saying they were saddened by the incident. “We have spoken to the principal and the college is equally shocked as she had never approached the department, administration, principal or faculty members for any help. LSR has a certified counsellor to help students. Even we have started a charity for needy students,” it added.

251,PRAYAGRAJ,['16-year-old'],Allahabad HC tells DGP to be present again in court on Thursday in Mainpuri girl’s suicide case,"PRAYAGRAJ: Taking a serious note of the laxity in the investigation of the suspicious death of a 16-year-old girl student of Mainpuri, the Allahabad high court on Wednesday directed the director general of police (DGP) to remain present before the court again on Thursday, saying, “We take such matters very seriously. Don’t think that she was a poor man’s daughter, she was the nation's daughter.” As per direction of the court, when the DGP along with the special investigation team (SIT) appeared before the court on Wednesday, he was directed to go through the records of the case and remain present again before the court on Thursday to clarify the action of the police authorities in conducting the investigation. The court further asked as to why disciplinary action against the then superintendent of police (SP), Mainpuri could not be completed before his retirement almost six months back. The Mainpuri girl was found hanging inside her school in suspicious circumstances on September 16, 2019. Her family members had alleged that she was sexually assaulted and killed. An FIR in this connection was lodged on the next day on September 17, 2019. Hearing a PIL filed by one Mahendra Pratap Singh, a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Munishwar Nath Bhandari and Justice Anil Kumar Ojha observed, “Despite the seriousness shown by the court to the case and the manner of the investigation coupled with direction against the defaulting police officer, no follow-up action has been taken, rather the matter is not being briefed to the DGP, UP to know the sensitivity of the case.” “In view of the above, we are left with no option but to keep this matter for September 16, 2021 at 10am as the first case when DGP, UP and members of SIT would remain present in the court to clarify about the action of the police authorities in making the investigation,” the court added. In the PIL, the petitioner has alleged that police were not fairly investigating the incident and were rather protecting the actual accused. Also, even the SIT formed for investigating the case was not acting independently. “We hope that good sense prevails and appropriate action is taken against the erring officers who neither interrogated the matter properly nor collected the medical evidence and sent it to the forensic lab within time,” said the court. Earlier on Tuesday, the court, after going through the case record, had observed, “It is found that though the FIR of the incident dated September 16, 2019, was lodged on the next day having allegation and naming the accused but interrogation of the accused was not made immediately or within reasonable time, rather it was done after almost three months.” Hence, in this backdrop, the court had said that it seems that the SIT team investigating the matter was not acting independently and had accordingly directed the DGP of UP to remain present before the court on Wednesday. Now, the case will be listed for the next hearing on September 16, 2021. ",15-09-2021,"['suspicious', 'death', 'poor', 'suspicious', 'killed', 'seriousness', 'allegation']"
252,MUMBAI,[],"Bombay high court denies relief to school chairman who scolded boy, leading to his suicide","MUMBAI: Observing that the language of reprimand must not be such that it shatters a tender mind, the Bombay high court refused pre-arrest protection to the chairman of a school in Kolhapur after a class X student ended his life within hours of being scolded by him. Justice Vinay Joshi rejected the anticipatory bail application by Ganpatrao Patil, chairman of Symbolic International School. He was booked by Shiroli MIDC police station under IPC section 305 (abetment of suicide of child). In the FIR filed on April 2, 2022, a man said he was called to the school a day before and asked to take his grandson home. The boy told him while he was playing football, the goalpost guard inadvertently hit a girl injuring her. Patil had scolded and abused him in filthy language. When the grandfather met Patil, he again said the student was “ill-cultured, has no chances of reformation and he is a slum boy” . Abuse directly linked to suicide, says HCThe Bombay HC has refused to grant pre-arrest bail to Ganpatrao Patil, chairman of a Kolhapur-based school, in an abetment to suicide case of a Class X boy. Patil had summoned the boy’s grandfather and told him he should be rusticated. He added the boy has “no right to live in this world” and is a “burden on this earth”. The grandfather took his grandson home, and within a few hours, the boy hung himself. Patil’s advocate Hrishikesh Mundargi argued that the allegations do not disclose criminal intent and being chairman of a school and a disciplinary authority, his act of reprimanding a student cannot be construed as instigation to suicide. Prosecutor M R Tidki said Patil’s act of humiliating, abusing and continuous harassing of the student amounts to sufficient instigation. He created the circumstance that led the student to end his life within hours. Justice Vinay Joshi took note of several complaints of parents against Patil. “As regards the case in hand, the utterances of the applicant are objectionable. No doubt he can reprimand students, but not in such a language which would shatter the tender mind,’’ he said in his April 25 order. The court referred to witness statements that Patil had scolded the boy in an unruly manner. In the presence of a teacher and the grandfather, he was again scolded using foul language. “Prima facie it suggests the applicant has created an impression in the mind of the student to put him in deep frustration... there is a direct link of the applicant’s act since within few hours from the episode, the child has ended his life by suicide. A young student has lost his life in proximity to the act of the applicant,” said Justice Joshi. Agreeing with Tidke that probe is on and Patil’s custodial interrogation is necessary, he said “no case is made out to grant pre-arrest protection”.

The students are of the view that if lectures were conducted online, then exam should also be conducted online. The students also tried to enter the university premises, but were stopped at the gate. Santosh Kandekar, head of the protesting students, said, “The summer examination of all the traditional courses under Mumbai University (MU) will be conducted online and the examinations of Pune Agriculture University, Rahuri, Nagpur University, Chhattisgarh University, Allahabad University will also be conducted online. In democracy, even if the university is different, the degree obtained from the university is the same across the country. One rule for one university and another for the other is against the principle of natural justice.” Yogita Yadav, another protester, said, “The academic year is from June to May. However, the fifth semester examination of final year students for December 2021 was conducted in 2022 and it is compulsory for the university to hold the sixth semester exam in May 2022. Still, the university is conducting the exam in June.” She said, “If the exam is held in June, students will not have time to study for competitive exams like Bar Council of India and will not be able to appear for it. So, the university should hold the exams online in May 2022 itself.

After Manjunath Pujari was found hanging from a tree near the Government Boys’ Residential School in Darshnapur village on January 21, 2021, the police first recorded it as a possible suicide. The boy’s father, Mallappa, however, was unconvinced and kept digging for details behind the boy’s death. Mallappa found out that Manjunath was dating a girl, a Class X student, in Darshnapur village. They were from different castes and the girl’s family was against the relationship. The girl’s family had told Manjunath to stay away from the girl. Mallappa reapproached the police and filed a fresh case alleging murder and insisted that the cops conduct a fresh inquiry. The police started investigation on July 3, 2021, after forming several teams to expedite the probe. The police also sought permission to subject all the accused to a polygraph test and managed to get one accused to do it. The police found out that Manjunath was from the Kurba community, while the girl was from the from Kabbaliga community. C B Vedhamurty, the Yadgir superintendent of police, told TOI that the girl’s father, Ramanna, opposed the relationship and told Manjunath more than once to stay away from the girl. Manjunath persisted. The furious father, with help of three relatives, decided to kill Manjunath. They beat up Manjunath and then hanged him from a tree on January 21, 2021, SP Vedhamurty said. “During our investigation, all four accused admitted that they had killed Manjunath for his relationship with the girl because he was from a different caste. We arrested all the accused two days ago,” the district police chief said. ",12-02-2022,"['cracked', 'suicide', 'killing', 'suicide', 'death', 'murder', 'furious', 'kill', 'killed']"

The first case was reported on Monday when a final year student of Ayurveda allegedly hanged herself at her husband’s home in Kollam district. The reason that has now come out according to her parents is that her husband Kiran Kumar, a 27-yearold assistant motor vehicle inspector, was unhappy with the brand new car that was given along with 1.20 acre of land and 100 sovereigns of gold. Their marriage took place last year. “She had told us that she was being harassed constantly as the new car (costing over Rs 10 lakhs) had low mileage and he wanted to sell the car and buy a new luxury car,” said the mother of the young girl. “We were shocked to hear about her death and much to our surprise the mark on her neck was very low. What we are being told is that in a hanging case, either motion or urine is seen. In my daughter's case, everything appears to be mysterious,” said her father. The police meanwhile has arrested Kumar and he admitted to causing her bodily injuries, but on the day she died no such thing had happened. Meanwhile Kumar has been suspended from service after former leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala asked the state transport and motor vehicle minister Antony Raju to take appropriate action. In another case, a 24-yearold girl ended her life by setting herself on fire and her 26-year-old husband Suresh was taken into custody as he was seen with a bottle of fuel. This incident occurred near Kovalam, in the state capital city. Here too the villain is now reported to be dowry as the deceased's mother said the boy’s family was demanding more dowry. The marriage took place last year. In a third case that surfaced on Tuesday a 19-year-old girl was found hanging in her husband's home at Alappuzha. At the time of the incident, only the girl’s husband’s parents were there. The police have started a probe. Minister for animal husbandry J Chinchurani who also hails from Kollam district said action will be taken by the police and Kumar’s mother will also be made an accused. State police chief Loknath Behera said that the police will act strictly and will take appropriate action after a thorough probe in these cases.

In 2018-19, the department, thinking much beyond their established task of enforcement of anti-drug laws, have been training tribal youths at Njaraneeli near Nedumangad for at least one year to equip them for facing competitive examinations for various government jobs offered by the public service commission. Five such youths who attended the coaching were shortlisted in PSC’s rank list for various jobs. The department initiated the idea after it received an alarming report from the health department, that suicides are on the rise in the area, and at least 50% of those committing suicide were drug addicts. Meanwhile, opposition leader VD Satheesan will visit the tribal hamlets in Vithura and Peringammala on Tuesday. The visit is in the wake of allegations that the excise and the police are not accepting complaints from tribal parents that drug mafia are trying to exploit their girl children pretending to be love affairs. The visit by the opposition leader will be along with Congress leaders from the district.

The students, who claimed that they did not represent any political party, had invited MLA Vikas Thakre during their meeting with the VC. Thakre assured them he would extend all the cooperation to them. “We explained to VC the disastrous effects of the offline papers, if conducted at this time. We shared our plight on how the students were being forced into depression over the online/offline confusion created by the university. Some of them are also displaying suicidal tendencies on the possibility of pen and paper exams,” the students, including Harsh Nagdevte, Munish Perke, Neel Kanhere and others, said. The students apprised Chaudhari of a plethora of complaints sent to the NU administration by the final year students regarding the Maharashtra government’s decision on holding the exams in pen and paper format. “If the final year exam is held offline, their results would be inordinately delayed. It will have adverse effects on their future prospects like postgraduate admissions and jobs. Those aiming for seeking admissions in the foreign universities would miss their deadline. Many of them have to arrive from outside states for appearing in papers,” they said. Chaudhari told them that NU would take any further decision before or after May 25 convocation, as only four universties had started offline mode while rest were still waiting green signal for online papers. “The VC told us that if offline exams are held, it would lead to delay of final year results. We had informed minister Uday Samant about problems being faced by the students in case of offline exams and we are waiting for the government’s directives in this regard,” the students said. Before them, the activists of Nationalist Students Congress (NSC) and National Students union of India (NSUI), had staged protests in front of NU’s Jamnanlal Bajaj administrative premises against the offline exams. A big number of students from four districts of the region came out to support them carrying flags and banners demanding online exams.

Just two months into the new academic year, six students under 16 years have committed suicide, and two sexual abuse cases among minors have been reported in the district. The district child protection unit is planning to conduct counselling for students and parents in the district to tackle these issues. According to the district child protection officials, three girls and three boys ended their lives in the district within one month. In another incident, two boys, aged 13 and 14 years of age, sexually abused two minor girls under the Udumbanchola police station limit. In January, a 14-year-old girl was found pregnant. The girl was sexually abused for a long time by a 16-year-old boy who is also her relative. The incident was reported under Cumbummettu police station limits. District child protection officer Geetha M G said that these issues have become a headache. “In the last academic year, mobile phone usage issues and lockdown-related stress had started to show in some children. But this year, the number has largely increased,” she said. “To tackle such issues, the district child protection unit will provide counselling to students and parents. The district has 68 school counsellors, and they have been given training. Counselling will start from next week onwards,” said Geetha. Consultant psychiatrist Dr C J John said that students are exposed to things that are only suitable for adults and are not prepared or equipped to handle it. “In plantations, children are alone at home. Ideally, students there should move to a place near their schools where teachers can supervise them while following Covid guidelines,” said Dr John. “These children get a device with internet, and there is a chance to misuse it. In the reported sexual abuse cases, they tried to experiment with the girls. They are not aware of the issues or seriousness of such acts,” he said.

278,VIJAYAWADA,[],"AP farmer kills 2 daughters, ends his life along with wife","VIJAYAWADA: A debt-ridden farmer of Nandyal town in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh killed his two teenage daughters and then committed suicide along with his wife.  This is the first incident of farm-related suicides in the drought-hit Rayalaseema region of the state this year. Though instances of individual farmers ending their lives are common in the state, this is the first time in the recent years that an entire farmer family had entered into a suicide pact, unable to clear the farm debts. According to the police, Mancha Chandrasekhar, 37, and his wife Kalavathi, 32, gave soft drinks laced with a pesticide to their two daughters, Anjani, 15, a Class X student, and Akhila, 13, a Class VIII student, before they themselves consumed it. The incident is believed to have taken place on Tuesday, but came to light on Wednesday after a friend of Chandrasekhar went to his house, but did not receive any response on knocking the door. He then peeped into the house through a window and found the bodies lying on the ground. Nandyal deputy superintendent of police Chidananda Reddy told TOI that the police broke open the door and found the entire family dead. They had consumed soft drinks laced with a pesticide. Preliminary investigation revealed that Chandrasekhar had taken a huge loan of up to Rs 1 crore to build his house, apart from the debt he incurred due to crop loss. A dent in the revenue due to Covid-19 drove Chandrasekhar and his family to take the extreme step.  “We are investigating the case and so far, we learnt that there was close to Rs 1 crore debt that the family owed with a huge drop in income. This is the main reason for their suicide pact,” Chidananda Reddy added. The cops also suspect that there could be a cricket betting angle behind the suicide pact as the police team investigating the case found that Chandrasekhar had lost money in gambling too. The police shifted the bodies to Nandyal government hospital for postmortem. A case was registered under Section 174 of CrPC (unnatural death) at Nandyal town police station.

As per police data, as many as 380 people have died of suicide over the past one year — throughout 2020 — and of them, around one-third (126) were women while 24 were children and teenagers (aged below 18). An analysis by TOI shows that suicides increased during the lockdown, and job loss, personal disputes, strained or broken relationships, poor health and depression are some of the major causes. According to the data, as many as 26 cases of suicide were reported in January, 17 in February and 22 in March 2020. The number started showing a gradual uptick, with as many as 27 suicide cases being reported in April and 31 in May. The suicides continued to rise from the beginning of the Unlock too — as many as 35 suicides were reported in June, 42 in July, 33 in August and 47 in September. October saw the highest number of suicides at 53, and in November and December, the figures were 35 and 11, respectively. The uncertainty and the financial burden brought forth by the pandemic have resulted in a huge socio-economic crisis before most middle-class families, say psychologists, “but the expectations from women have increased even more”. Neharshi Srivastava, a psychologist with the Rehabilitation Council of India, told TOI, “The pandemic has seen a rise in domestic violence, sexual and mental abuse of the women. With aggression at high and the families together for hours, it has resulted in an increase in expectations from women who many a time become the target of the aggression from the males of the families.” “Out of the 100-odd calls that I have received throughout the pandemic, only four-five pertained to men. Children too have become prone to deteriorating mental health because of the uncertainty and restriction from the ‘normal life’,” she said. While the Union social justice and empowerment ministry has set up a toll-free helpline number (1800-599-0019), the Noida police officers have said that a specialised helpline is also being planned. “We want it to be a community-led initiative and would like to rope in RWAs and NGOS for the same,” DCP (women’s safety) Vrinda Shukla said.

With the pandemic leading to online classes, school students are now able to use mobile phones frequently and this in turn also makes them vulnerable to cybercrimes. Kerala Police have come up with a training program for parents to ensure the safety of children during online study time.The training programme named Digital Safe is being implemented as a joint collaboration of the UNICEF, Children and Police and Student Police Cadet. The project aims to promote the safe use of internet and to protect children and others from online abuse and violence. In the first stage of training, 1,500 parents completed the sessions in five phases in the district.“We focused on parents because it is their reaction towards a situation which sometimes makes most of the cases worse. This could even lead to suicides among children. So, it is important for the parents to know that they should behave nicely with their children by giving them proper advice. The parents will also be able to prevent such occurrences,” said Sabu Neelakantan Nair, the project’s master trainer.The classes were given to the parents by presenting 11 real life cyber cases dealt by Kerala Police. The topics including cyber bullying, online class intrusion, movie piracy, online gaming and account takeover, online defamation, online nudity, child pornography, mobile addiction, unauthorized access, online drug sale and sharing user credentials were discussed among parents. The classes also gave information regarding legal implications, being safe online and contacts to seek immediate help. The major topic discussed was how a parent should react when they come to know that their child is a victim of cybercrime or has committed a crime.The topics are presented to the parents by researching on the information provided by the teachers. It has been found that children use mobile phones for 18 to 20 hours per day and also many children are becoming more active on social media. The groups that attract children to various kinds of fraud have also become active. During the session, the parents acknowledged instances where their children have become addicted to various social media platforms since they started using mobile phones.

He said his son was ridiculed and defamed and accused of molesting a girl, but there was no proof. “Police have not yet recorded the statements of all the persons who had shared the post and were part of the group,” he said, adding the chargesheet had not covered all aspects of the “crime”. “I am completely dissatisfied with the investigation conducted in the case, which is biased and unfair. I have been providing information and evidence, but the police failed to act on it,” he said. Advocate Vishal Gupta, counsel for the girls, said it was his client who was the victim. “This is a case thrust upon the girls,” Gupta said. The girl, then 17, wrote the post when #BoisLockerRoom was dominating conversations among high school students. In a conversation with this correspondent last year, the girl had said she and some of her close friends found themselves revealing personal experiences to each other, about objectification, casual sexual aggression and vulgarity they regularly got subjected to, and the ‘normalisation’ of it, which angered them. “I told them about my experience. Everyone was shocked. They told me I should no longer be silent and that the story needs to be out there. In that moment, I decided to stand up for myself and tell my story. I knew I’ll be trolled but I wanted to say it,” she had said. Praised after the post for her bravery, she was trolled viciously after the boy’s death. “I deactivated my account because of the filth that I was being subjected to after his death. It’s sad he took this step. But, that doesn’t prove my story wrong,” she had told TOI. According to the girl, the alleged incident took place they were both in Class X and had become friends. The boy, she claimed, had come to her housing society and proposed a walk in the basement. There, she claimed, he had touched her inappropriately and demanded sexual favours. Later, a post by a person identifying himself as the brother of the boy, posted from an Instagram account, claiming the boy had received threat calls and texts, after which he had tried to defend himself and told his friends he was innocent. The post said he couldn’t handle the constant threats and believed his side of the story would not be heard and that he had a panic attack, which drove him to suicide.

312,MANGALURU,['29-year-old'],Up to 15% people suffering from depression have suicidal tendency: Mental health experts,"MANGALURU: The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (ASSOCHAM) organized another edition of the webinar series on ‘Illness to Wellness’ campaign, themed around “Depression Management and Treatment”. The webinar was organized with an objective to cascade mass awareness and disseminate knowledge & wisdom to combat depression and promote healthier and happier life during the current scenario. The online event was graced by a team of eminent mental health experts who shared their valuable inputs on Depression management, which included - P K Dalal, president, Indian Psychiatric Society and former professor and head department of psychiatry, KGMU, Lucknow; Dr Ishita Mukerji, program director and senior psychologist, Kaleidoscope; Dr Akshay Kumar, associate consultant, mental health and behavioural science, Artemis Hospital, and Dr Rajesh Kesari, founder and director, Total Care Control who served as a moderator for the panel. The campaign running under a CSR initiative aims at promoting healthy living with a keen focus on wellness and preventive health through healthy habits, diet, exercise, and holistic health. Sharing his perspective, Dalal said, “Depression is one of the most common mental disorders. It occurs across all the age groups and is twice as common in females as compared to males. It is treatable and the treatment should be started as early as possible. It can also occur quite commonly with the other chronic physical and mental disorders as well. If left untreated it can be severe in intensity and can lead to even suicidal tendency, a psychiatric emergency.” Around 10 to 15 per cent people suffering with depression can commit suicide and around 20 per cent more can attempt for suicide. The person should be immediately hospitalised and treated. There are now good medicines and other therapies available for the treatment of depression, he said. “Medicines to treat depression are neither habit forming nor sedating in nature. The treatment can be easily tapered off after the person remains fully asymptomatic for a considerable period,” Dalal noted. The key to get to the core of the issue is by addressing and communicating in a safe space. “The continuing stigma associated with mental illness was the reason why we decided to come out and talk openly about it”, said Dr Mukerji. “For someone living with depression, acknowledging their emotions and talking to a person they trust is often the first step towards treatment and recovery,” he said. “A better understanding of depression and how it can be treated, while essential, is just the beginning. What needs to follow is sustained scale-up of mental health services accessible to everyone, even the most remote populations in the world,” said Dr Mukerji. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), depression is one of the leading causes of disability. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among 15-29-year-olds. People with severe mental health conditions die prematurely as much as two decades early due to preventable physical conditions. These facts are a waking reality for all countries to re-think their approaches to mental health and to treat it with the urgency that it deserves. The expert panel in coherence expressed that depression is bio-psycho-social in nature, because of which a strong link between developing depressive symptoms & chronic illnesses can be established. Amidst the many important inputs during the webinar, it was also suggested that physicians who diagnose patients with chronic disorders must map the psychological impact with equal importance as comorbidity can magnify due to interlinking of diseases. Between adjusting to Work from home, children’s online school-college education, lack of contact with other family members, friends and colleagues and accepting the changes of lifestyle while mitigating the fear of contracting the virus, the mental health of people took a beating. Stress became a common and consistent emotion. In severe cases, it even led to clinical depression. Reflecting on how stress and depression are often confused with each other, Dr Kumar, one of the experts among the pantheons from the field of mental health said, “Stress and anxiety are very different from Depression. Stress is not a disorder, but more of a reaction triggered by an external stimulus which may be uncomfortable. It is often used within the professional context to indicate an uncomfortable situation, wherein we must be careful not to interchange the meaning of sadness, stress, anxiety, and depression. Having said that, chronic disorder can lead to depression, if not monitored within time.” The critical takeaways from the insightful session, included ways to handle a person with suicidal ideation with utmost vigilance on behalf of family members & social support, tips to parents and children on time management and active listening to prevent feelings of isolation and detachment, stages of postpartum depression, looking out for symptoms of depression in someone suffering from prolonged sadness and normalizing seeking professional help to resolve and steer ahead. Dr Rajesh Kesari who moderated the session also shed some light on the gravitas of the topic and highlighted the need of acknowledging the existence of the problem of depression, which is still considered a taboo, as he successfully summarized the discussion with expert inputs of the panel.

313,MUMBAI,[],"Scolded, student ends life; HC denies pre-arrest bail to Maharashtra school chairman","MUMBAI: Observing that the language of reprimand must not be such that it shatters a tender mind, the Bombay HC refused pre-arrest protection to the chairman of a school in Kolhapur after a class X student ended his life within hours of being scolded by him. Justice Vinay Joshi rejected the anticipatory bail application by Ganpatrao Patil, chairman of Symbolic International School. He was booked under IPC section 305 (abetment of suicide of child). In the FIR filed on April 2, 2022, a man said he was called to the school a day before and asked to take his grandson home. The boy told him while he was playing football, the goalpost guard inadvertently hit a girl injuring her. Patil had scolded and abused him in filthy language. When the grandfather met Patil, he again said the student was “ill-cultured, has no chances of reformation and he is a slum boy” and should be rusticated. He added the boy has “no right to live in this world” and is a “burden on this earth”. He took his grandson home, and within a few hours, the boy hung himself. Patil’s advocate Hrishikesh Mundargi argued that the allegations do not disclose criminal intent and being chairman of a school and a disciplinary authority, his act of reprimanding a student cannot be construed as sufficient instigation to commit suicide. Prosecutor M R Tidki said Patil’s act of humiliating, abusing and continuous harassing of the student amounts to sufficient instigation. He created the circumstance that led the student to end his life within hours. Justice Joshi took note of several complaints of parents against Patil. “...The utterances of the applicant are objectionable. No doubt he can reprimand students, but not in such a language which would shatter the tender mind,’’ he said in his April 25 order. “Prima facie it suggests that the applicant has created an impression in the mind of the student to put him in deep frustration,” said Justice Joshi. Agreeing with Tidke that Patil’s custodial interrogation is necessary, he said “no case is made out to grant pre-arrest protection”.

325,MUMBAI,[],Maharashtra is suicide capital of India with 1 in seven cases; Mumbai 4th,"MUMBAI: Every seventh suicide in the country last year took place in Maharashtra, which saw over 5% increase to 18,916 deaths from 17,972 in 2018. The number of suicides rose 4.7% in Mumbai, which is placed fourth among cities with 1,229 cases, according to NCRB’s 2019 report on ‘Accidental Deaths & Suicides in India’. Overall, suicides in India— often called the world’s suicide capital — increased 3.4% from 1.34 lakh in 2018 to 1.39 lakh, with Maharashtra reporting the most deaths (13.6%). Farmer suicides accounted for one-fifth of Maharashtra’s suicide tally. Last year, the state had the highest share (38.2%) in India’s farmer suicides, which marginally declined to 10,281 from 10,349 in 2018. Financial crisis, family trouble, career trauma, angst making some end it allThe commonest reasons for suicide in the state and the city are financial crisis, family problems and career setbacks. Teenage angst is a matter of concern too. While most big states have arrested the trend of people ending their lives due to the most pressing of these problems, the NCRB’s statistics show that Maharashtra is an exception. And while most factors that drive people over the edge are sometimes perhaps uncontrollable, experts say societal intervention at the appropriate junctures could help save lives. They say the police have a role to play too. Taking a cue from such advice, joint commissioner of police (law & order) Vinay Choubey said police teams have been trained specifically to handle suicidal tendencies. “Our teams are trained in all aspects. Whenever we receive a distress call, we counsel the person. Also, we get professional help of counsellors to handle a situation if it is particularly tricky. Most calls are through social media or directly to the control room,” Choubey said. Former Sion Hospital dean Dr Suleman Merchant said copycat suicides account for 5% of youth suicides. “Financial stress, mental fatigue, excessive work pressure, and peer and parental work pressure are among the triggering factors. Fifty per cent of people who have committed suicide showed telltale signs. If recognized in time, they can help in prevention,” he said. India’s every seventh suicide in 2019 occurred in Maharashtra, with family problems, chronic ailments, mental illness, drug abuse, bankruptcy, unemployment and breakups as the major causes. As per the NCRB report, released on Tuesday, there were 1.4 lakh suicides in India in 2019, with Maharashtra accounting for 18,916. Farmer suicides accounted for a fifth of Maharashtra’s suicide load, with 3,927 farmers dying by suicide in 2019. Whether or not a person has work can be determining. Psychiatrist Dr Harish Shetty said 22% of those who committed suicide were unemployed and self-employed. Suicides in Mumbai increased marginally in 2019 from 2018. The sense of anomie and alienation is big in all metros, including Mumbai,” he said. “Disconnection remains the most important reason, leading to angst, mental health issues and ultimately the extreme step.” Coping mechanisms also have a role to play. Dr Nilesh Shah, who heads the psychiatry department of Sion Hospital, said suicide is the last resort of those with poor coping skills. “While roughly 20 lakh students take the SSC exams every year, four lakh fail (but most of them cope). But then, suicide could be committed by that student who was expecting 95% but got 90%.” He also said that suicide is a step sometimes taken by those with depression or serious mental health problems such as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. “So, we need to identify those with poor coping skills and help them.” (Inputs by Malathy Iyer)",03-09-2020,"['suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'marginally', 'crisis', 'trouble', 'trauma', 'suicide', 'crisis', 'problems', 'setbacks', 'concern', 'problems', 'suicidal', 'distress', 'tricky', 'stress', 'fatigue', 'excessive', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'problems', 'chronic', 'illness', 'abuse', 'breakups', 'suicide', 'dying', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'unemployed', 'marginally', 'alienation', 'issues', 'suicide', 'poor', 'fail', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'depression', 'problems', 'disorder', 'poor']"

Earlier, Kerala DGP, on the advice of Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, had written to Tripathy seeking a speedy investigation. After meeting the DGP, Latheef said Fathima had left a message on her phone alleging that the faculty member had been harassing her. “On the day of the incident, she sent her classmate to collect the answer sheet which clearly showed that she was scared of that particular professor whom she held responsible for her death,” he said. He accused IIT-Madras officials of giving “contradictory statements” to “cover up” the matter. “My daughter had the habit of writing notes and I am sure that she would have written a death note,” he said. “The DGP had not seen her note in the phone until we showed it to him,” he said. The IIT-M administration issued a statement saying its students, faculty and others were deeply saddened by Fathima’s demise. “The students, faculty, staff, and residents of IIT-Madras are deeply saddened and extremely perturbed by the unfortunate and untimely demise of our student, Fathima Latheef, and the events that unfolded thereafter,” the registrar said in a statement. He appealed to people “not to spread rumours about the institute” in the wake of the suicide. “Social media trolling of the institute and faculty members and trial by media, even before the conclusion of police investigation, are gravely demoralising students and faculty members and other staff,” IIT-M said.

339,PATNA,[],Bihar records 45% jump in suicide cases: NCRB,"PATNA: Bihar saw a nearly 45% jump in the number of suicide cases in 2019 — the highest in the country—, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data released on Monday. Altogether 641 suicide cases were recorded in the state as compared to 443 in 2018. Bihar is followed by Punjab with a jump of 37.5% cases while neighbouring Jharkhand is ranked third with a 25% rise in terms of rate of suicide cases. In 2018, Punjab recorded 1,714 cases, which increased to 2,357 cases in 2019 while for Jharkhand the number of cases went up from 1,317 in 2018 to 1,646 cases in 2019. At the national level, suicide cases saw a rise of 3.4% with 1,34,516 cases reported in 2018 and 1,39,123 cases in 2019. However, in terms of rate of suicide cases per lakh population, Bihar has the second-lowest rate among all states and Union Territories. Bihar’s suicide rate per lakh is just 0.5%, which is also much below the national average of 10.4% per lakh population recorded last year. This process is also presumed as a standard yardstick for comparison with others. As per the NCRB data, the biggest contributing factor in suicide cases in the state is family problems. With altogether 234 cases, Bihar ranked 10th across the country last year in suicide cases due to family problems. Altogether 160 men and 74 women committed suicide last year in the state due to family problems. Suicide due to marriage related issues is the second biggest factor in the state as per the 2019 data of NCRB. Altogether 111 suicide cases took place due to marriage-related issues, which included dowry, extra-marital affairs, divorce and others. Romantic relationships are the third big factor with 59 men and 42 women committing suicide due to this. The fourth-biggest factor exam failure due to which 58 boys and 37 girls committed suicide last year. Clubbing all these factors, Padma Shree Sudha Verghese, who had been working for the Dalits and the downtrodden section of society for several decades, said “Competitiveness, lack of freedom in society and family, amalgamated with the economic situation of the state results in the increase of suicide cases.” She added, “The young generation, be it unmarried children or married ones, must be provided more freedom within the family. There remains continuous tension between a woman, her husband and other family members most of the time. More susceptible ones succumb.” “Broad mindedness of family and society is required. People need to think beyond, caste, religion and region to bring down suicide cases,” she further said. According to her, extreme pressure on children and high expectation of parents is the root cause of suicide among students. “Parents pre-decide dreams and professions while children, if they fail, are disappointed to such extent that they are unable to face reality amid an absence of a support system. This ultimately pushes them towards suicide,” she said.

On Thursday, the court allowed the application, filed by the special investigation team (SIT) probing the death of the girl in the school three years ago. Ankur Agnihotri’s narcotic test will be conducted within a month, said special public prosecutor (POCSO) Anoop Yadav. Last year in September, blood samples of nearly 300 suspects including that of a cabinet minister’s son were collected for DNA test after a new SIT was constituted following the Allahabad high court’s direction to the state government and UP police to submit a progress report on the case within a month. The court had also directed the DGP to closely monitor the progress of the probe so that “it may be taken to its logical conclusions” as the investigation of the three-member SIT constituted earlier had remained inconclusive. The UP government had suspended three police officers after the high court’s observation. On February 1 this year, SIT had filed a chargesheet of over 2,000 pages against the former principal of a Mainpuri residential school, Sushma Sagar in the court of Additional District Judge (POCSO) Poonam under sections 306 (Abetment of suicide), 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of an offence committed, or giving false information) of IPC and under sections 19/21 of POCSO Act. The victim’s family had approached high court in August 2020, alleged they were not informed of the girl’s death and came to know of it when the school authorities took her body to a hospital and one of their relatives, who was present there identified the girl and called up the parents. Then, the FIR was filed against the then school principal, Sushma Sagar, hostel warden and a fellow student under POCSO Act and sections 376 (rape) and 302 (murder) based on the family’s complaint.

Hrisheek Koley, investigating officials said, mentioned in the suicide note his inability to cope with the sudden shift to Kolkata from Hooghly’s Singur. He had also told his friends about his growing frustration with the inability to comprehend classes in English and being forced to study physics instead of his first love, mathematics. Since Thursday, Koley’s body had remained unidentified at a Howrah morgue till cops there matched it with photographs of a “missing” youth sent by Kolkata Police. On Friday, Koley’s father identified the body and the handwriting on the suicide note as his son’s. According to the complaint lodged by the superintendent of St Xavier’s Hostel, Koley left the hostel around 10am on Thursday but never came back. “The CCTV footage shows him leaving around 10am. It is the time when students leave for their classes. But he did not return in the evening. His phone was switched off and we lodged a police complaint and informed his parents,” said Father Joseph Kulandai, the hostel super. Cops tracked his last cellphone tower location to Beckbagan. About two hours after he left the hostel on Thursday, officials of Belur GRP were informed about the body of a youth lying on the tracks between Uttarpara and Hindmotor stations. ‘Student didn’t carry mobile, ID’“The youth was not carrying any identity card or cellphone. He only had a rucksack, a handkerchief and a half-empty bottle of water. Neither did the note in his pocket have any names. That made identification of the body difficult,” said a senior officer of Belur GRP. The officer added their investigation had revealed that the boy got down at Hindmotor station, sat there for a while before walking down the tracks towards Uttarpara. “The note in his pocket mentions how frustrated he was with city life and that he was unable to follow the education pattern in college and feared his parents would get angry if he failed to deliver,” another officer said. Koley’s father Ratikanta is a government official while his mother is a school teacher. The family lives at Shantipuram in Singur, around 40 km from the city. Neighbours said Koley was a student of Singur Mahamaya High School and had scored above 92% in this year’s HS examination. He had applied for admission to a number of city and district colleges with mathematics and physics as his primary subjects. He was selected for mathematics at several premier institutions in the city and had taken admission at a college in Hooghly with a group of friends before his name came up in the third list for physics at St Xavier’s. He shifted to the hostel on Sunday. “He had told his school and college friends that he was unable to comprehend classes being taught in English and that he always wanted to study mathematics but was forced to take up physics at the insistence of his parents and teachers,” said an officer at Lalbazar. While his parents were too grief-stricken to speak, a neighbour told TOI that the boy had told the parents that he was finding it difficult to adjust in the hostel. “He used to say that he felt belittled because of his inability to speak fluent English. He wanted to come back home,” said Manas Ghosh, a neighbour. “He had attended only four classes till Tuesday. He did not attend college on Wednesday and left the hostel campus on Thursday,” said a senior officer at Lalbazar.

Though the report didn't mention Covid and the lockdown as likely reasons for the rise in suicides, an Assam government-sponsored 2020 study had predicted that nearly half of the state's population could be pushed into poverty if the present crisis increased the state's unemployment rate of 8% by more than two folds. According to an National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) study in 2011-12, the poverty headcount ratio in the state stands at 32%. There is also an increase in the number of suicides among students. About 390 committed suicides in 2020 compared to 357 in 2019. According to the latest report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), family problems accounted for 42.7% of the suicides in 2020, while love affairs also claimed 13.38% lives. Assam also saw 10 cases of mass or family suicides where 10 people lost their lives. The suicide rate (per lakh population) also increased from 6.9 in 2019 to 9.3 last year, the NCRB, which functions under the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), stated on Thursday. The national average of the rate is 11.3. Mental health experts believe suicide among children and adolescents is increasing due to insecure attachments and emotional disconnection with parents, friends and families. ""Stress over job prospects, joblessness and financial inequality may lead many to take the extreme step,"" they said, and added that experts expected an increase in suicides due to the situation arising out of Covid-19. ""Unemployment, Covid related stress and financial recession have resulted in depression and suicide. Another major issue is post Covid depression,"" they said. A total of 2,011 people, whose annual earnings were less than Rs 1 lakh and 998 others, who earned Rs 1 lakh and above but less than Rs 5 lakh, committed suicide. The report shows that of the total number of people who died, 673 had no education and 505 had studied up to Class V.

Kaushik, from Hosur, was a student of Alliance University. He and his friend Rahul had sustained minor injuries in the accident. Kaushik had expressed fear over facing his father’s wrath for having caused the accident before taking the extreme step, police said. The student had been staying in Hosur post the pandemic outbreak. On Sunday, he and his friends from Hosur visited Anekal and consumed alcohol. After the party, the group returned to Hosur, but Kaushik said he wanted to drink more. He drove back to Anekal ignoring his friends’ advice and took along his friend and neighbour Rahul. Kaushik was driving his Mahindra XUV towards Anekal when he lost control of the vehicle — it toppled thrice around 8pm. As Rahul and Kaushik didn’t suffer major injuries, locals arranged for an auto and suggested they go to hospital. However, the duo headed to Kaushik’s Anekal house. Kaushik wasn’t carrying the house keys and broke open the door to enter. While Rahul slept in the room, Kaushik slept in the hall. He later locked Rahul’s room from outside and hanged himself from the ceiling. Rahul, who woke up later, screamed for help realising he had been locked. Neighbours heard him and alerted police. Anekal police said they have registered a case of unnatural death. Kaushik’s father, a contractor, arrived in Anekal to receive his son’s body.

344,VIJAYAWADA,['22-year-old'],"MBA student's death: Circumstantial evidence points to suicide, say police","VIJAYAWADA: While police are yet to call it a suicide, evidence collected so far in the case of the death of the physically challenged village volunteer and MBA student Ummaneni Bhuvaneswari suggests that she may have immolated herself with petrol. The 22-year-old died under mysterious circumstances at Ongole in Prakasam district on Friday night. Bhuvaneswari’s mobile phone, police believe, holds the key to confirming whether her death was suicide or a murder. Just before her death, Bhuvaneswari updated her WhatsApp status to “it is going to be my last status message and please don’t call me again”. Police also located her messages on another application, Hago, over the last 15 days. On this app, Bhuvaneswari updated a message that read “15 days to go” and went on to update the message every day, in a countdown. The latest evidence collected by the police has been CCTV footage from near Bhuvaneswari’s house. Police noticed that she left home in a handicapped tricycle with a bottle of petrol and headed towards the place of incident. The footage shows a man acquainted with Bhuvaneswari who purchased petrol and handed it over to her about an hour before the incident was reported. The man has claimed that Bhuvaneswari asked him to buy petrol for her as she needed it for making a YouTube video. Speaking to TOI, Prakasam SP Siddharth Kaushal said that while all circumstantial evidence points to suicide, “however, we are neither ruling out anything nor confirming anything at this point in time as there are still some dots to be connected before coming to a conclusion. We are yet to retrieve the data from her phone as she has sent multiple messages and there are some incoming messages as well. As the phone was also burnt along with her to the level that the physical memory cannot be retrieved, we are trying to recover data from the cloud.” Apart from digital data, police are also waiting for the postmortem report to come to a conclusion. Another motive that points to suicide is that Bhuvaneswari had no disputes with anyone in the village. As a village volunteer, she was on good terms with everyone and helpful to the elderly and beneficiaries of government schemes. In the days preceding her death, Bhuvaneswari showed signs of depression, such as a message on social media that said, “what is the worth of life and what is the value of life”. While her friends did not anticipate her death, they recalled her messages.

Aishwarya, an IAS aspirant, was found hanging at her Shadnagar house in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district on November 2. In a suicide note purportedly written by her, the 19-year-old woman said she did not want to burden her parents with her educational expenses, police said. While members of the Congress-affiliated National Students' Union of India (NSUI) protested outside the residence of Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ""Nishank"", the Left-affiliated All India Students 'Association (AISA) staged an agitation outside the Delhi University's Arts Faculty. According to the police, seven NSUI members were detained for a few hours and a case was registered against them under the Disaster Management Act. ""Scholarships are to reward a student's academic achievement and educational prowess. Be it while starting your career or studying in high school to grow new abilities, receiving a scholarship is a prominent achievement. The Indian education system begets issues in it. One of the major issues is the increase in the cost of college, school and university fees,"" NSUI national secretary Lokesh Chugh said. ""The student from Telangana committed suicide after being denied scholarship for over a year by the government. She had written to the administration about the problems she was facing but unfortunately, received no response from the authorities. This is just a recent example of how imperative scholarships are for students. When the government delays the provision of funds to students, it puts them and their families under immense pressure,"" he added. LSR principal Suman Sharma, however, denied that the student had reached out to the college authorities. ""We have a counsellor at the college to help students if they are facing any challenges emotionally or mentally. However, nobody knew about her state of mind. It is unfortunate, we wish she had reached out either to her teachers or the counsellor or anybody in the college,"" she said. In a statement, the AISA said, ""We pledge to stand and struggle in solidarity with all the forces dedicated to deliver justice to the family and the student community. We demand that all the un-disbursed fellowships and scholarships be disbursed immediately to both the grieving family and the student community."" The All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) said ""in a country where the gross enrolment ratio of girl students into higher educational institutions shows a pathetically skewed figure, a girl such as the LSR student, who struggled to reach Delhi with the dream for education, has been killed"". ""We believe that the present government ruled by the BJP not only has been criminal in its actions towards Indian students and citizens, but has eroded all principles of justice and equality.

Referring to an April 2017 letter written by co-accused Rona Wilson to a wanted accused Prakash the court said, ""prima facie speaks that the CPI (Maoist)was bent upon to end the Modi­ Raj i.e. the Modi-led Government. Not only this, they were also thinking to go for another incident like the death of Rajiv Gandhi, by targeting the road shows of Modi."" Special public prosecutor for NIA Prakash Shetty said letter by ‘R' —co­accused Rona to Prakash states that ""Modi led Hindu fascist regime is bulldozing its way into the lives of indigenous Adivasis. In spite of big defeats like Bihar and West Bengal, Modi has successfully established BJP Govt in more than 15 states. If this pace continues then it would mean immense trouble for the party on all fronts. Greater suppression of dissent and more brutal form of Mission 2016 (OGH). Com. Kisan and few other senior comrades have proposed concrete steps to end Modi­raj. We are thinking along the lines of another Rajiv Gandhi-type incident. It sounds suicidal and there is a good chance that we might fall but we feel that the party PB/CC must deliberate over our proposal. Targeting his roadshows could be an effective strategy. We collectively believe that survival of the party is supreme to all sacrifices.” In its detailed reasoned order, Special Judge D E Kothalikar who rejected the bail plea on February 14 said the special public prosecutor Prakash Shetty submitted that everyone knows the manner in which the death of late Rajiv Gandhi had taken place. “If these allegations are taken into consideration in proper perspective… there will be no hesitation to prima facie conclude that there is a prima facie case against the applicants that they have done an act with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security and sovereignty of India and with intent to strike terror in the section of the people in India by other means to likely to cause the death of, or injuries to, any person or persons,” said the Special court. The order said “witness K. Satyanarayana has also stated, in his statement that the applicant was in touch with the co­accused Varavara Rao and that the applicant was the part of Sai Baba Defence committee”, attended meetings with Rao in Delhi and “was a sympathizer of the Maoist”. Babu’s lawyer D K Gaikwad submitted that there are more than 50 prosecution witnesses and that the charge sheet runs in 30,000 pages and it will take a long time to commence the trial and if during the trial he is in custody when maximum sentence attracted is 10 years it would violate his right to life and liberty. The SPP said the prosecution was ready for trial but it was halted as the accused had gone to Bombay high court for quashing the case and sought a stay. The court referred to more letters and witness statements to deny him bail. It said a letter “issued by the co­accused Surendra to the wanted accused Prakash” reveals that “ on 30.04.2017 an agitation was arranged at Jantar Mantar and …co­accused Surendra had circulated the points which were in their favour in the case of Saibaba” A “document called ‘Agenda' states that the name of the applicant was proposed as a member of the team which would act as a secretariat for defence committee. These documents also prima facie suggests the link of the applicant with the co­accused” said the order noting one witness statement which says Babu “took over the charge and became the convener of the Committee” Hany Babu’s claim before the court was that the prosecution has levelled allegations against him that he was a member of the CPI (Maoist) a banned terrorist organisation under the first schedule of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and that he was in correspondence with the members of the outfit. It has further been alleged that Hany Babu participated in a committee constituted to organize legal defence for a member, Saibaba and that he was involved in raising funds and inculcated Maoist sympathies amongst students and other persons. His case was that all the allegations made by the prosecution against him make out only an offence punishable under Section 38 and 39 of the UAP Act i.e. associating/membership with a terrorist organisation and supporting a terrorist organisation. He had also argued that there is “ no material to suggest” he was intended or supported a claim of the cessation or caused disaffection against India or committed an act which disrupts the sovereignty or territorial integrity of India and as such, he claims that the offence under Section 13 is not made out. He has further claimed that offence punishable under Sections 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 of the UAP Act, 121, 121­A and 124­A of IPC are not attractive.

While Janki Devi Memorial College (JDMC) is using unutilised funds from collected fees and contributions from teachers to help at least 70 students, the alumni of Hindu College has decided to set up a fund to provide monetary assistance of up to Rs 20,000 to certain students. JDMC principal Swati Pal told TOI that the college “has always been proactive in assisting students with financial issues. A group of teachers has, over the past few years, contributed to assist students”. During the pandemic, the number of such students has gone up as the income of many parents has got affected, she said. “While earlier we used to get 30-40 applications, this time the count is over 70. We asked the students to fill up a form and provide an income certificate, and also held an online meeting with them” to clarify certain matters, Pal added. While teachers have contributed more, the governing body has allowed the college to utilise around Rs 3 lakh of the fee amount that could not be used after the Covid lockdown was declared in March, the principal said. The funds collected from students, Pal pointed out, are to be used during that academic session for various activities. Old Students Association of Hindu College will give up to Rs 20,000 each as a one-time study grant to cover annual college fees of the needy students whose family annual income is below Rs 5 lakh. “As a long-term move, we are planning to set up an ‘OSA — Principal P C Verma Study Grant Fund’ to pay the annual fees every year. Students will be selected on a need-cum-merit basis,” said its president Ravi Burman. Former students can send a cheque in favour of “Old Students Association, Hindu College” or make online donation through the alumni portal, he added. ",28-11-2020,"['suicide', 'issues', 'needy']"

Soon after stabbing the student to death, the youth stabbed himself in a bid to end his life. His condition is stated to be critical. The incident occurred under Machavaram police station limits on Thursday. It is suspected that they were in love. The victim was identified as Divya Tejaswini. According to Machavaram police, the incident came to light when the girl’s parents, who returned home, found Divya and the attacker, Nagendra Babu, a painter by profession, lying unconscious on the bloodstained floor. The police shifted them to hospital, where the girl succumbed to bleeding wounds. City police commissioner B Srinivasulu told media that the girl received deep cut injuries on her neck. As the condition of Babu deteriorated, he was shifted to Guntur Government General Hospital (GGH) where his condition is said to be critical. “Since the youth was present in the house at the time of the incident, we suspect that he might have committed the crime against the girl,” Srinivasulu said. On the other hand, family members of Nagendra Babu came forward revealing that the two had secretly got married and released a selfie taken by them where the woman was seen wearing a mangalsutra. Sources said Nagendra met the girl’s parents on Wednesday night explaining that they had married. But the parents said the marriage was not valid as there were no witnesses to it. Sources said police, who examined the crime scene, found a cloth hanging from the ceiling fan and suspect that both might have contemplated suicide and later might have chosen to do it by slitting themselves. However, in the girl’s case, cops cite that the cut injuries on the neck seem to be inflicted by Nagendra, who then slit his own wrist and neck as well. Cops said that as there were no witnesses as to what happened inside the girl’s room, they are banking on Nagendra’s statement as to what had transpired. The commissioner of police said the man is able to talk a little and they were waiting to question him after his treatment.

The nursing student was found hanging in the bathroom of a hostel in Mangaluru on Tuesday. Police said a suicide note suggested her family was struggling to pay her college fees which was the reason for the extreme step. Dr Kiran Kumar PK, president, IPSKC said: “Since manpower is available 24/7, the government must direct medical institutions to launch helplines on priority. Although most of the calls received are during the night, hospitals are well equipped to deal with any emergency.” He said counsellors must be told to spread awareness on existing helplines in all education institutions starting from high schools. Students too must be educated to identify symptoms of depression among friends and classmates. “All that a person suffering from depression needs is someone to listen to them and make them feel better,” Dr Kumar said. “About 90% of suicides can be prevented through proper intervention. The IPSKC has already begun work on strengthening existing helplines to prevent suicides, and we are drawing up plans to set up more helplines.” Between March 2020 and September 30, 2021, Mangaluru City police recorded 394 suicide deaths. Of these, 259 cases were due to hanging, 96 drowned, 32 poisoned themselves and seven deaths were due to burn injuries.

Also, 71 suicide-poisoning cases were reported in 2019, 59 in 2020 and 50 in 2021. Dr Kiran said: “Though cases due to hanging top the list in terms of attempts, we have observed that victims mostly prefer consumption of poison or tablets. Sometimes victims try different methods together.

Between January and May, 71 people had committed suicide and in December, 10 people ended their lives Incidentally, the 252 deaths included 27 youngsters, four undergraduates and 23 school-going students. ""The Covid-19 induced closure of the educational institutes and the subsequent ban on outdoor activities perhaps impacted negatively on the young minds to take the extreme step, as the data suggests,” Ram said.

Maximum of 33 suicide cases in the Tricity were reported in Mohali. Four cases were reported in Panchkula. According to the suicide data of Chandigarh, most of the 21 persons who committed suicide hanged themselves. Despite talk of depression triggering suicide during lockdown, police did not confirm this. Absence of suicide note and family inputs has made it difficult for them to ascertain the reasons for suicide, police said. On March 19, a 32-year-old man allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself at his residence in Ramdarbar late at night. The deceased was supposedly anxious due to closure of his workplace but no suicide note was found. On May 16, a BA second year student student allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself at her residence in Dhanas. Again, the reason is not clear. In Panchkula, four cases of suicide were reported during lockdown. One person attempted suicide by jumping off a mobile tower in Chunabhatti village. Panchkula police said of the four suicide cases reported, two were from Rajiv Colony, one from Fatehpur village, Sector-20 and one from Tanda village, Chandimandir. According to data provided by Mohali police officials, 33 cases of suicide were reported from March 15 to June 15. Of these, police initiated proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPc (Police to enquire and report on suicide) while cases were registered under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. Superintendent of police, investigation, Harmandeep Singh Hans said, “We make sure to complete all the formalities on our side.” Recently, a 15-year-old girl committed suicide by hanging herself on Sunday. She left behind a suicide note saying, “Sorry Mummy Papa.” Police said cases under Section 306 of the IPC are mostly registered on recovery of the suicide note, which clarifies whether the victims were forced to commit suicide or whether they took the extreme step on their own. Police said a postmortem report clarifies facts to a greater extent and a suicide note is given more weightage than statements of family members. In most cases of suicide in Mohali during the lockdown, prime reasons were depression as well as stress. On June 2, a 35-year-old man committed suicide in Derabassi because of losses suffered during the Covid-19 crisis.

They said their investigation led them to believe that the girl, a resident of Sangowal village, was not good in studies. However, the school authority said the girl did well in studies. On January 16, a Class XII student of the school allegedly committed suicide in her house. However, her family, without informing police, cremated her body. Later on, a non-governmental organisation, Universal Human Rights Organisation, took up the matter with the police after which the police initiated the probe. Satnam Singh Dhaliwal, the president of the NGO, said on January 11 another Class XII student of the same school had hung herself in the school. “It is not normal that five days later another girl should also commit suicide. Police should thoroughly probe the case to know if both cases are linked or not. Also, it should be investigated why the parents did not inform police and cremated the girl without autopsy,” he added. Inspector Sukhdev Singh, station house officer of Dehlon police station, said, “The police have investigated the case and found out that the girl did not do well in studies. As the exams are approaching, she must have given into pressure and took the extreme step. Though the parents should have called the police for autopsy, nothing suspicious has come out of investigation. The probe is almost complete now.” While speaking with TOI, school principal Samriti Bhargav said, “She was a student of humanities stream and was good at it. The police have not approached us to get her academic record.” She added, “If the girl has committed suicide, I don’t believe it is due to the study pressure. Both online and offline classes are being conducted according to the convenience of the students and with the consent of the parents. Moreover, till now it is not ascertained whether the exams will be conducted online or offline. There is no way a good student of humanities stream will take her life over exam pressure.” When asked if both the girls, who have died, were friends, Bhargav said, “I came to know that they probably were friends but I don’t know how close their friendship was. In the first case though, the girl has left a suicide note.” Additional deputy commissioner of Police-2, Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said, “I have asked the ACP-South to submit a report.” ",26-01-2021,"['suicide', 'suicide', 'hung', 'suicide', 'suspicious', 'suicide', 'died', 'suicide']"

She alleged that Jain, who is in his 60s, spiked her drink and molested her at the guest house. He later went to her flat and allegedly raped her. After some days, Bhatt went to the woman’s flat and demanded physical relation. When she refused, Bhatt threatened her with dire consequences and then allegedly raped her, according to the FIR lodged.  “The woman said that on September 14, the accused sent her nude photos to her male friend and threatened to make them viral. They also threatened to kill her. The girl said that the accused had also set up spy cameras in her bedroom outside her knowledge,” the police added.  “We have registered a complaint against the duo who are yet to be arrested. Once they are arrested, we will be able to get more details of the crime,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP) SV Rajgor. This is the second such complaint of rape registered in the city in the last four months. In June this year, a 19-year-old girl was gangraped by two of her colleagues Nazeem Mirza and Dishant Kahar at her residence. The duo had got the girl drunk and then forced themselves upon her. She narrated the ordeal to her father and a day later he committed suicide.

375,CHANDIGARH/PANCHKULA/MOHALI,"['32-year-old', '15-year-old', '35-year-old']","In lockdown, 33 gave up on life in Mohali, 21 in Chandigarh","CHANDIGARH/PANCHKULA/MOHALI: A total of 21 cases of suicide took place in Chandigarh during lockdown. Maximum of 33 suicide cases in the Tricity were reported in Mohali. Four cases were reported in Panchkula. According to the suicide data of Chandigarh, most of the 21 persons who committed suicide hanged themselves. Despite talk of depression triggering suicide during lockdown, police did not confirm this. Absence of suicide note and family inputs has made it difficult for them to ascertain the reasons for suicide, police said. On March 19, a 32-year-old man allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself at his residence in Ramdarbar late at night. The deceased was supposedly anxious due to closure of his workplace but no suicide note was found. On May 16, a BA second year student student allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself at her residence in Dhanas. Again, the reason is not clear. In Panchkula, four cases of suicide were reported during lockdown. One person attempted suicide by jumping off a mobile tower in Chunabhatti village. Panchkula police said of the four suicide cases reported, two were from Rajiv Colony, one from Fatehpur village, Sector-20 and one from Tanda village, Chandimandir. According to data provided by Mohali police officials, 33 cases of suicide were reported from March 15 to June 15. Of these, police initiated proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPc (Police to enquire and report on suicide) while cases were registered under Section 306 of the Indian Penal Code. Superintendent of police, investigation, Harmandeep Singh Hans said, “We make sure to complete all the formalities on our side.” Recently, a 15-year-old girl committed suicide by hanging herself on Sunday. She left behind a suicide note saying, “Sorry Mummy Papa.” Police said cases under Section 306 of the IPC are mostly registered on recovery of the suicide note, which clarifies whether the victims were forced to commit suicide or whether they took the extreme step on their own. Police said a postmortem report clarifies facts to a greater extent and a suicide note is given more weightage than statements of family members. In most cases of suicide in Mohali during the lockdown, prime reasons were depression as well as stress. On June 2, a 35-year-old man committed suicide in Derabassi because of losses suffered during the Covid-19 crisis.

Of the 81,758 students who committed suicide from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2018, 57% killed themselves in the past five years, including 10,159 in 2018, the data revealed. Overall, India saw 1.3 lakh suicides in 2018, of which students made up for 8%, almost the same as those involved in the farming sector, while 10% of them were unemployed people. A quarter of the student suicides in 2018 were because of ""failure in exams"". Experts said causes ranged from drugs to depression, to broken families and breakups.  While psychologists say clinical depression, schizophrenia and other mental health issues and addiction to drugs and alcohol are the three most common reasons, sociologists and rights activists call it a psycho-social problem. Sociologist Samata Deshmane pointed out that people, especially students, are finding it difficult to cope with the transformation in society. Arguing that human beings are ""social animals"", she said, ""But today, we are less social and more individualists."" State-wise analysis of student suicides in 2018 shows that just five of them - Maharashtra (1,448), Tamil Nadu (953), Madhya Pradesh (862), Karnataka (755) and West Bengal (609) - account for 45%, or 4,627 cases. Between 2014 and 2018, the same five states, along with Chhattisgarh in two years, have accounted for the highest number of cases. Child Rights Trust director Nagasimha G Rao argues that students, especially those over the age of 10, don't have avenues to vent, which makes it difficult to manage stress. Dr M S Dharmendra, consultant psychiatrist, Manasa Neuropsychiatric Hospital, had earlier told TOI there are multiple factors, including sociological, psychological and biological factors. ""It all depends on how they are able to handle stress, how they perceive a situation. There are biological factors too as we are all born with certain predispositions to depression,"" he said. Our genetic makeup gives us some vulnerability to depression. Some have low vulnerability and in a few others it may be high,"" he said.

There was no immediate trigger, said assistant superintendent of police (ASP) Sarvesh Mishra, but the family claimed that the boy would remain glued to the TV watching the news of the actor's suicide.  According to police, the boy - whose father is an engineer with a private firm in Greater Noida - was at home with his mother, elder sister and grandmother when he went to a room upstairs, bolted the door from inside and hanged himself with a cloth.  The postmortem wasn't conducted at the insistence of the family, said police. Psychologists attribute such incidents to lack of parental regulation and guidance to children watching such news items.

The girl allegedly committed suicide on Sept 7 and police had initially registered a case of unnatural death. Police said she allegedly took the extreme step due to mental strain. It was found that the teacher was sending inappropriate messages to her on social media and this came to light after the father examined her phone and reported the matter at school. As the teacher had sent inappropriate messages, she would have been under mental strain after the issue was reported by her parents to the principal during a PTA meet. Following this, the principal had taken up the matter with the teacher, police said. Melparamba inspector Utham Das T said the messages were inappropriate to be sent to a 12-year-old student.

388,Kolkata,[],40%-60% suicide victims visit docs before death,"Kolkata: More than half of those, who choose to end their lives, visit a physician four to six weeks prior to their suicide — this stresses the need for recognition of the signs of extreme distress or despair among these people, say psychiatrists and experts. Other than the family, the society and their kin, non-specialist doctors, too, have a role in suicide prevention and need to be trained and sensitized about such patients, they pointed out. September 10 is observed as World Suicide Prevention Day. “Around 40%-60% of those dying by suicide visit a general physician shortly before ending their lives. In most cases, these doctors fail to recognize that they are in extreme distress, which could be dangerous. So, we need trained people to identify these potentially suicidal section of people and initiate measures,” said president of Indian Psychiatric Society Gautam Saha. He added that “gatekeepers” or people trained to identify someone contemplating suicide was necessary. Psychiatric J Ram said that busy, urban life was leading to a disconnect and isolation that often triggered suicidal tendencies. “A large number of youngsters, for instance, are under tremendous pressure to perform. Unfortunately, it is the parents who are often responsible for this. What they don’t realize is that education has nothing to do with doing well in exams. But that is exactly what students are expected to do. And those, who fail to live up to parents’ expectations, have to go through the stress that is harmful,” said Ram. A majority of those resorting to suicide are aged below 30 years. “We need to frame a mental health policy that will help to have a specific protocol of identifying and treating the depressed with suicidal tendency,” said Saha. Tolerance levels have come down drastically among youngsters today, claimed a psychiatrist. “They refuse to accept harsh criticism and often fail to handle emotional upheavals. Soft parenting has changed children’s attitude over the years. Till about a decade ago, parents could be very harsh with children without worrying about consequences. They would rampantly compare one child with another within the family or in the neighbourhood or school. But with time, interaction with children has turned more sensitive. But some parents continue to be an exception and they still stick to the old, rejected methods of driving children. The latter find it hard to accept when they find that their peers are being treated better,” he explained.

The girl’s parents alleged the note was forged, pointing out that the writing did not match their daughter’s. The family claimed this was the same note the authorities had spoken about when they had visited the school on July 3 but did not show it to them. The Class X student’s parents had earlier found a few notes in her school bag in which she had scribbled how she was “wronged” and was upset with her life because she did not have any friends. “There is no reason for my death — neither the school nor my parents. I don’t have any reason to live and every human being lives for a reason. As it is, I had become a burden on everyone. Mother, I had become a burden on you…. You will get what you want,” read the note that was circulated on Monday. The girl had allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling fan of her classroom on July 3. The school authorities allegedly cremated the body in Bhangel without informing police, who got to know about the case only after the girl’s parents appealed to the UP government for justice on Sunday. The student’s mother alleged that the note was an attempt by the school to mislead police. “When we reached the school on July 3, we were told that our daughter had left a suicide note in which she had blamed me for the extreme step. We pleaded with them to show us the note, but they refused. The writing on the note they released on Monday is not my daughter’s. A 14-year-old girl who wants to commit suicide will not write such a clean note,” the mother said.She demanded that the notes written by the girl earlier and the one released on Monday be examined by a handwriting expert. Meanwhile, discrepancies have also emerged in the receipt issued by the Bhangel cremation ground authorities. The receipt says the girl died at home and the cause of death is mentioned as fever. Additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh said, “In the note, the girl has mentioned that nobody is responsible for her death. We have asked her parents to give us whatever they consider evidence.” Singh said the ACP (women’s safety) would visit the girl’s family in Haryana and an FIR would be lodged after a complaint is filed. The chancellor of the school accused the girl’s family of stopping the authorities from informing police. “The girl had a fight with her younger sister (who studies in the same school) and was upset since then,” he added.

But even if he had any prohibition case against him, why would he commit suicide,” said Patel, adding that even the mobile phone of the deceased is missing. “The way his body was found on the railway track itself raises suspicion that he was murdered,” said Patel, adding that the city police commissioner has assured a thorough probe.

The colleges have stepped up efforts after an LSR student died by suicide allegedly over financial constraints in continuing with her studies. According to Lady Sri Ram college Principal Suman Sharma, the college administration has announced reduction in fee for a few courses, setting up a committee to provide laptops and allowed some second-year students to reside in hostels. ""Given the fact that students are not able to avail certain facilities of the college due to being off-campus, the college has removed such charges from the fees this year. This has led to a substantial reduction in the fee. In addition, it is possible to pay the fee in installments,"" she said. ""Keeping in mind the exceptional circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, current second year students upon fresh application and on the basis of need will be allowed to stay in the hostel after the commitments to incoming first years and the current third years, who already are in the hostel, have been met,"" he added. Miranda House Principal Bijaylaxmi Nanda said the college is working on facilitating internet data packs to students on whom the burden has increased due to classes moving online during the pandemic. ""We realised it during the first month of lockdown only that just online classes will not be enough and equal attention will have to be paid to mental wellness. We took some steps but we will increase our efforts now and focus on one-on-one interactions,"" Nanda said. ""We are exploring options for offering financial support to students not just in terms off fee waiver but to provide internet data cards as well to help in online classes,"" she added. The staff association of the St Stephen's college has also approached college principal, demanding setting up of a committee to reach out to students facing monetary issues. ""As we are all aware, the pandemic has caused great distress in the society. There is an increased financial hardship and some of our students are facing genuine difficulties in accessing online classes and paying the fees,"" staff association president Nandita Narain said. ""Some of the faculty members have been receiving requests from students for help with both the payment of fees and also for obtaining devices to attend the online classes. We fear that there are many more students out there who have not yet reached out,"" she added. According to Simrit Kaur, the principal of Shri Ram College of Commerce, the college has been receiving requests for scholarships and laptops since the lockdown. ""There are a few students who had their own devices but there were a few who needed help with laptops, we have tried facilitating each student with the kind of help they needed. We are also providing round-the-clock counselling services to students so that if there is any issue it can be addressed timely,"" Kaur said. Aishwarya, a student of the Lady Sri Ram (LSR) College for Women and an IAS aspirant, was found hanging at her Shadnagar house in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district on November 2.

400,Gurgaon,['16-year-old'],"A critical case that was handled all wrong, say experts","Gurgaon: The suicide of a teenage student of a frontline school in Greater Faridabad has highlighted the often-neglected issue of bullying and stereotyping and its far-reaching impact on mental wellbeing. The 16-year-old boy’s counsellor and child psychologists said the case was an example of everything that should not have happened to deprive a sensitive teenager of the atmosphere or the mechanism to cope with his trauma.“This is a classic case of mishandling a critical case like that of this child. That he reached out for help and his mother made sure that everyone was aware of his situation suggests that besides the kid, the bullies needed handling with care and intelligence. It should be an eye-opener for us; how conditioning and stereotypes impact the psychological growth of kids, especially those who are at the receiving end of such behaviour,” said Harsimran Singh, a city-based psychologist.Psychologists and domain experts said bullying is a symptom of a bigger problem taking root in young minds. From the social behaviour of parents to stereotypes they see around them, the conditioning of young minds ignores the concepts of inclusivity and a peer-group support system.“Teasing somebody for their complexion or height or even the way they walk and talk starts very early, and because there is such little awareness and importance given to psychological health, these habits go unnoticed and come into light only when things go out of hand. Kids learn the concept of sexuality or body-shaming or even making fun of weakness through various channels, both consciously and subconsciously. It is important to observe such behaviours and use a scientific approach to negate such behaviours,” said Dr Arvind Kumar, consultant psychiatrist at Ram Manohar Lohia hospital and former head of the department of psychiatry.Experts further said that while a few teenagers facing bullying get forced into the dark alley of self-doubt and take drastic steps, others live with baggage and build unhealthy behaviours. “Depression and anxiety are just forms of impact. Bullying, the constant self-doubt that comes with it, lack of support systems, among other things, lead to the snowballing of much deeper psychological issues. Kids grow up either isolated and with low self-esteem or aggressive and abusive in their interpersonal relations,"" said another Delhi-based psychologist Deepali Batra.Starting with training teachers and parents to create a structured module around these issues, experts listed several pointers for raising kids while ensuring their mental wellbeing and emotional intelligence. “Teachers need to be trained to be alert of such behaviour. Even the one bullying is going through a mental health issue and aggressively projecting insecurities. Identifying such students and counselling them through the intervention of domain experts should become the mainstay of dealing with teenagers,” Singh added. Others called for periodic psychological assessments for kids to identify early signs of bio-psycho-social disorders in behaviours and subsequent corrective measures.",27-02-2022,"['suicide', 'issue', 'bullying', 'deprive', 'critical', 'bullies', 'bullying', 'symptom', 'problem', 'unnoticed', 'weakness', 'negate', 'bullying', 'dark', 'drastic', 'unhealthy', 'anxiety', 'lack', 'issues', 'isolated', 'aggressive', 'abusive', 'issues', 'bullying', 'issue']"

In a suicide note he left behind, he accused the Punjab revenue minister Gurpreet Singh Kangar of visiting his village on August 15, when he was not feeling well and had tested Covid-19 positive, said a farm body. Balbir Singh (55) of Kotda Kalan village in Mansa, in the handwritten suicide note, demanded strict action against Kangar and Mansa DC for accompanying the minister. Balbir, who was village president of newly formed farmer organisation Bharti Kisan Union Mansa, had reached the deputy commissioner office complex on Monday to lodge his protest where he is learnt to have consumed a poisonous substance. The people at the office informed the police, which took him to the civil hospital from where he was referred to Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot, where he was declared brought dead. Gurpreet Kangar, after presiding over an Independence Day function at Mansa, visited village Kotda Kalan to inaugurate government smart school. He was accompanied by MLA Nazar Singh Manshahia, DC, SSP and many others. Bharti Kisan Union Mansa president Bogh Singh claimed that the district administration had ensured assembly of a large number of persons, including some students, against the guidelines, putting life of many in danger. “Many persons were not wearing masks. When the government is making big announcements for people not to come out, why did the minister come when he was not feeling well and not even was wearing mask? We demand Rs 10-lakh compensation, a job to a member of the family and waiver of loans against the family. We will not allow the post-mortem till our demands are met,” he said. Balbir is survived by wife, a son, daughter in law and two grand-daughters. The family owned 3 acres of land. His son, Amandeep Singh, said they wanted justice for the death of his father. Mansa deputy commissioner Mohinder Pal, who is in quarantine, said, “The minister knew about his medical condition. It is here that he got tested and report was received late on August 15. If we had known that the minister is positive, there was no point in attending any function”. Mansa senior superintendent of police (SSP) Surendra Lamba said, “We have seen the suicide note. It will be looked into by speaking to the family members of the farmer about his health condition to know if he was stressed. Police are looking into the issue. Anything could be said only after the statement of the family is recorded,” he said. Minister Kangar, who is in isolation, was not available for comment.

411,MUMBAI,[],Cyber harassment cases see upswing in pandemic,"MUMBAI: The pandemic seems to have resulted in a surge in cyber harassment cases. Over 900 complaints were made to an anti-cyberbullying platform from 257 Indian cities last year. A report by the platform, Cyber Bullying Action Awareness Prevention (CBAAP), says most complaints pertain to trolling, followed by sextortion. “Not everyone is comfortable going to the police directly, particularly in cyberbullying cases. Instead, they look for help and not finding any could push them into depression. We founded the CBAAP platform to reach out to such individuals, offer counselling and assist them in lodging an FIR, if needed,” said psychologist Nirali Bhatia, its co-founder. Among the top three cities that cyberbullying complaints were received by CBAAP were New Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai. College and school students formed a huge chunk (60%) of complainants. “Kids and young adults are very sensitive to opinions people have of them... This makes them vulnerable to cyberbullying,” said psychiatrist Dr Payal Sharma Kamath. Some complainants who approached CBAAP were suicidal. “It’s not easy to get an FIR lodged in emotional harassment case,” Bhatia said, adding that she often has to counsel families of complainants too since their support is very vital. “There have been instances, particularly of revenge pornography or image abuse, where I have to make the families understand how a victim has been targeted,” she said. “Fear of parents’ inability to understand or the feeling that parents will make the situation worse are major concerns we see among young victims of cyberbullying,” added Dr Sharma Kamath. CBAAP got more complaints from men (54%) than women in 2021. Most were from Uttar Pradesh, next Maharashtra. Bhatia cited a case where a newly married man was cyber-harassed via a fake profile. “His wife and sister’s photos were morphed over obscene content and circulated to his relatives through the fake ID. The display picture was of the man and his ex-girlfriend to convince his relatives he had created the obscene content, although he was the victim,” said Bhatia.

Considering a petition (WP-C No. 10867/2020) challenging collection of school fees despite the lockdown, citing improper online classes through WhatsApp, and lack of action by the state government in controlling the situation, justice CS Dias observed in an interim order, “It is disheartening to learn that a student allegedly took away her life due to lack of access to the Internet for attending virtual classes.” Stating that right to education is sacrosanct in the Constitution and is the mandate under Right to Education, the court issued a stay on collecting fees from the petitioner and referred the case to the chief justice to be considered as a public interest litigation. The petition was filed by a student of Sree Budha Central School at Karunagappally. The court has ordered the school not to levy any additional fee from the student until further orders. In the petition filed through advocate Manu Ramachandran, it was contended that several states and union territories have formulated guidelines for conducting online classes and have ordered that students should not be denied education for not paying fees during the pandemic period. However, no such guidelines has been issued by the Kerala government, it was alleged. Further, the petition said the online classes now being conducted are not virtual or online classes in its real meaning and yet unreasonable fees are being charged under the heads of smart classroom facilities and computer charges. The online class is being conducted at the school by sending voice messages of teachers through WhatsApp to the parents, who are to download them and teach the children below 6th standard. The petitioner is ready to pay the tuition fees on monthly basis if online or virtual classes in its true sense is provided by the school, the petition said while pointing out the lack of guidelines to set standards for conducting online classes.

413,MUMBAI,[],"SC asks Maharashtra if Payal Tadvi case accused can join BMC, state hospital","MUMBAI: Supreme Court on Tuesday directed the state to appraise it if three doctors accused of abetting the suicide of their junior, Dr Payal Tadvi (26), can join any BMC or state hospital. Hema Ahuja (29), Bhakti Mehare (27) and Ankita Khandelwal (28) had moved court seeking to resume post-graduate degree in gynaecology and obstetrics. “The state will also inform court if in the facts and circumstances of the case, migration of petitioners could be permitted to any hospital attached to Mumbai Municipal Corporation or state or nursing centre of the concerned hospitals,” the court said. Medical Council of India said migration was not permissible. MCI’s advocate Gaurav Sharma said in instances cited by petitioners, a Haryana college was shut so all students were accommodated in different colleges. In the second case involving ESI-PGIMSR College, Andheri, there was a fire there, leading to students being temporarily shifted to another institution. “To say that they should not even be allowed to migrate, we would not like that kind of a submission from the complainant,” the court said. Payal’s mother, Abeda, objected to their pleas to resume studies. Her counsel, senior advocate Indira Jaising, submitted that since regulations were clear that no migration would be permissible, the court ought not to pass orders on that plea. Pointing out that police had recorded statements of more than 250 witnesses, the court also directed the state to appraise it about status and stage of trial. It also directed that BYL Nair Hospital be made party to the petition through its director. The accused, studying there at the time of the incident, completed two of their three-year degree course. Tadvi had hanged herself in her hostel room on May 22, 2019. Ahuja, Mehare and Khandelwal were accused of ragging, torturing and harassing her because of her caste she belonged to the scheduled tribe Tadvi Bhil. They were arrested few days after the suicide and granted bail by Bombay HC on August 9 last year. Among the conditions, HC directed them not to enter the college. Their subsequent plea seeking relaxation of conditions and resuming studies at the same institute or another, were rejected by HC.

IPC Section 309 – which deals with attempted suicide – was decriminalized under the Mental Healthcare Act in May 2018. Earlier in the day, the woman from Attingal gave her statement to the local police that she had no complaints against anyone (in particular), which contradicts the things she mentioned in her note. Attingal police had registered a man missing case on Thursday evening after receiving a complaint from her parents. The student allegedly gave the same statement to a local magistrate at Attingal, it is learnt. Meanwhile, higher education minister KT Jaleel directed the higher education department secretary to submit a detailed inquiry report on the incident. State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) also registered a suo motu case in connection with the incident on Saturday. SHRC chairman Antony Dominic asked the college education director and principal to submit a report within a month. Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala sought stringent legal actions against those responsible in this case. “College unions should indulge in healthy activities instead of resorting to goondaism. Complaints suggest that even students attending exams were forced to attend union events. There have been many incidents at University College where students were forced to participate in strikes. Those resisting were subject to harassments,” he said. KPCC chief Mullappally Ramachandran too criticized SFI activists at the college, listing recent incidents of atrocities against students inside the campus and policemen outside the campus. KSU district committee organized a protest march to the commissioner’s office demanding the arrest of SFI leaders involved in the incident.

Police submitted their findings in a confidential report to the state home department last week. An investigating officer confirmed that the team arrived at the conclusion after interviewing about150 people, including hostel staff, Latheef’s hostelmates, professors and her collegemates.

The reason may be frequent quarrels with her husband, said police. A case of accidental death has been lodged. The deceased has been identified as Mamta Jadhav. Her son was a Class I student. An official of the Chandkheda police station said that the death occurred at around 1.15pm on Thursday. He said the residents of the building heard a loud thud and the scream of a woman. The residents found Jadhav and her son in a pool of blood. They called a 108 ambulance and took the two to a nearby private hospital where they eventually died. An investigator said that it was difficult to immediately determine whether the woman had jumped from the terrace or the third floor of the 10-storey building. “Disputes broke out between the woman and her husband Chirag after he lost his job during the lockdown,” the cop said. “The financial crisis continually triggered fights.” Inspector B K Gamar of the Chandkheda police station said that clues were yet to be gathered in the case. His superior, assistant commissioner of police, L division, D S Patel said that it appeared prima facie that the woman was pushed to the brink by the harassment from her husband. “The deceased woman’s father on Friday registered a complaint of abetment to suicide and domestic violence against her husband with the Chandkheda police,” Patel said.

A case has been filed against seven members of the woman’s family in this connection. N Savithiri of Idaiyanvalasai village was said to have committed suicide by hanging herself at her house on June 11. Her body was cremated at the village crematorium the same night by the family without informing the police. On Saturday, her lover R Vivek, 20, of Thoppukollai village, raked up the issue with the support of All Indian Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA). A wall-painter by profession, he and Savithiri, a final year college student, were in love for the past eight years and both belonged to different communities. With the woman’s family opposing the relation, Vivek and Savithiri decided to tie the knot and left their houses on June 7 for Coimbatore by car. Police at Kulithalai check post in Karur intercepted their vehicle and enquired with them. “As they revealed their proposal for marriage, police verified their age and found Vivek to be below 21 years, the minimum age limit of marriage for men,” said AIDWA Pudukottai district secretary D Salomi. The issue was moved to the all-women police station (AWPS) in Karur where the family members of both sides were summoned. The police sent the couple home separately with their families. “Savithiri pleaded with the police not to send her with her family citing threat to her life. Yet, the police sent her with them instead of keeping her at a government home,” said Salomi. On receiving the petition from Vivek and AIDWA, Pudukottai superintendent of police P Ve Arun Sakthikumar has ordered a thorough inquiry into the death of Savithri. Forensic experts collected the mortal remains, particularly her bones, from the crematorium. “Probe is on and we have booked the family members of the woman for concealing the news about her death and cremating her body,” the SP told TOI.

While many of these students, the doctors say, were brought in for acting aloof, not eating, with some also attempting suicide or writing suicide notes. Alarmingly, it is not just the students who have scored lower than expected marks, but even high scorers (90 to 98 per cent) who are among those seeking professional help. While there is a marked jump in cases this year as compared to previous years, experts say that an increase in awareness (which has led to identification), high expectations, as well as ‘role modelling’ (more talk about suicides due to failure, which leads the child to believe it is normal behaviour to get rid of pain) are reasons for taking the extreme step. In fact, cases started pouring in a few days before results and experts say that unrealistic and high expectations is to be blamed. “Each year before exams, during exams and after results there is an increase in cases, but this year the numbers are much higher,” said Dr. Minhaj Nasirabadi, secretary, Hyderabad Psychiatric Society. While experts have equated the student suicides to a chain reaction—very similar to that of farmer suicides reported during previous years—many with ‘suicide intent’ were identified by parents. “In the last one week alone, I have seen four cases of inter students who had suicidal tendencies,” said Dr K Srinivas, consultant neuro psychiatrist, Maxcure Hospitals.

447,INDORE,[],"Indore: Newly-wed student jumps off mall, 2 days after hubby’s death","INDORE: A newly-wed MBBS student tried to end her life by jumping from the third floor of a mall in Indore on Friday afternoon, two days after her husband’s alleged death by suicide. They were married just 15 days ago. The victim, Saniya Khandelwal, suffered head injuries and multiple fractures and is now in ICU. A note found in her handbag said she wanted her last rites to be done with that of her husband, Shubham Khandelwal. Saniya’s suicide bid put the spotlight on Shubham’s death as well. A civic contractor in Ujjain, he was found fatally injured in his car, which had struck a tree, on Wednesday night. Two letters addressed to chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and home minister Narottam Mishra were found in his pockets, along with a suicide note where he blamed two officials of Ujjain Municipal Corporation. Police now say he had swallowed five packets of poison before the car crash. After investigating his suicide note, police registered a case against sub-engineers Naresh Jain and Sanjay Khujner for harassing him mentally and threatening him, said Chintaman police station in-charge Mahendra Makashre. Guard sprinted to prevent suicide, missed by inchesAfter Shubham’s funeral on Thursday, Saniya’s father arrived in Ujjain to take her back to hometown Faridabad. The father-daughter travelled to Indore on Friday morning and checked into a hotel near Sarwate bus stand to wait out the hours before their afternoon flight. They were on their way to the airport, when Saniya said she wanted to have some juice and got into C21 mall, said police. She went to the third floor, and climbed the railing. CCTV footage shows her standing on the railing for around 41seconds. The staff and security guards noticed her and one of them sprinted to save her. She jumped, dodging a guard’s outstretched hand by a few inches. The horrifying scene was caught on CCTV. Mall staff rushed her to hospital, where she was wheeled into ICU. Her father later shifted her to MY Hospital. Saniya had come to temple town Ujjain from Faridabad four years ago to study medicine. Here, she met Shubham, and they married in a simple ceremony at Ujjain’s Chintaman temple 15 days ago. On Wednesday night, they received news that Shubham had died in an accident. Ujjain ASP Rupesh Dwivedi told TOI that police found he had consumed five packets of poison while driving the vehicle, and vomited several times in the car. He lost control of it and met with an accident. Before Makashre could investigate the scene, doctors had handed over the body to family members, believing it was an accident. He was cremated without his viscera being preserved for further autopsy. After seeing the accident site, police had rushed to stop the cremation, but in vain. FSL expert Preeti Gayakwad has collected vomit samples and other items from the car for forensic examination. Police investigated the suicide note, which named two Ujjain civic officials. Shubham claimed in the note that the duo was not releasing Rs 13 lakh due to him and not signing the measurement book. The accused sub-engineers had also registered a case against Shubham at Chimanganj police station a few days ago for allegedly vandalizing their car and throwing stones at their house.

The meeting will be attended by officials in the rank of SP and above. In the recent past, the police have been coming under severe criticism, including from the high court, for various lapses and misbehaviour with the public. The agenda for the meeting includes a review of state intelligence status, effective disposal of the pending petitions, effective and timely investigation in Pocso cases and effective investigation in cases relating to atrocities against women and SC/ST categories. The meeting will also formulate strategies to deal with family disputes and effective police response. The police inaction in the case of Anupama Chandran in the capital initially, citing it as a family dispute, had cost the force heavily. Another major area that will come under discussion will be the behaviour of the members of the force while dealing with the public. The latest instances of severe criticisms from the high court against the Pink police and the suicide of a law student in Aluva after visiting the police station, have come as a huge embarrassment to the force as a whole, despite repeated instructions for behaving politely with the public has been given to the police officials from time to time. The meeting will also review the expenditure of the Plan funds and the funds for the modernization of the police force, and would take stock of the various ongoing constructions and projects. The need to ensure patrolling at nights, presence of police officers on roads in the mornings and evenings and the progress in community policing initiatives, including Janamythri, student police cadets and the Kadalora Jagratha Samithis, will also figure in the discussions during the meeting.

The bodies were discovered on Friday morning at their first-floor apartment at Sanjay Nagar in Arthala, Sahibabad. The man, Dheeraj Tyagi (29), was from Bijnor and worked at a welding shop in Sahibabad. He lived in the single-room apartment with his wife, Kajal (27), and their two children — Ekta and Dhruv. Ekta had just started out as a nursery student at a school in the locality. Kajal“Main Dheeraj Kajal se bahut pyaar karta tha, par Kajal ladkon se phone par baat karti thi (I, Dheeraj, loved Kajal a lot, but she would speak to men on the phone),” went the purported suicide note, scribbled with a black marker on a pink wall, right next to photos of Kajal and Ekta. To the left of the note was a heart pierced by an arrow and the letters ‘D’ and ‘K’, and four numbers of the “men Kajal would speak to”. A nearly empty bottle of rum lay toppled on the floor. “It’s possible that he got drunk, killed his family and then himself,” a police officer said. Every morning around 9, Dheeraj and a friend, Bheem, would go to work together. “When Bheem got here on Friday morning and called him outside the house, there was no response. He called Dheeraj on the phone and got no response again. He went upstairs and knocked. When there was no response again, he managed to prise open a window and get in,” said Kaushalya, the landlady. “He found Dheeraj hanging and the bodies of the others on the bed.” Bheem scrambled downstairs, told Kaushalya and they informed police. “They had to break the door open to gain entry … Just yesterday night, I had seen Dheeraj return from work with dinner he had bought for the family,” Kaushalya said. She didn’t hear anything on Thursday. And the single-room apartment right next to Dheeraj’s is occupied by a single man, who was away at the time. And there may have been other problems. Their son, Dhruv, had been sick since birth and undergoing treatment at a Delhi hospital. “Dheeraj had been facing a financial crunch. Dhruv’s treatment was expensive and Dheeraj had borrowed money for that but not been able to repay his creditors … In September last year, Dheeraj had bought a 50 sqm plot in Ghaziabad, registered in Kajal’s name. He had been planning to sell that off to pay for their son’s treatment,” he added. Dheeraj seems to have suspected Kajal’s brothers were trying to get hold of that plot, a family member said. “Is saari kahaani ki wajah Kajal ke bhai hain (At the root of all this are Kajal’s brothers),” a postscript to his ‘note’, scribbled in pencil, said. A neighbour said she had never witnessed any sign of trouble in the household. Police are waiting for the autopsy reports before deciding on the next line of investigation. “The reports will disclose the exact cause of death but it does look like Dheeraj strangled his wife and children with his hands. We will look into everything Dheeraj wrote in his suicide note,” said Ghaziabad SSP Kalanidhi Naithani.

A Vinod Karuvarakundu, member of the committee who visited Malabar Christian College and the house of the deceased student Jaspreet Singh on Tuesday, said prima facie there were lapses on the part of college authorities in taking required steps to enable the student write the exam, despite him having genuine reasons for the attendance shortage. “The ongoing internal investigation by the committee appointed by the management and the police probe are not looking into the factors which led to the suicide like the mental torture the student had to face. What is needed is a probe into the allegations raised by the family of the deceased student by an independent committee of the varsity and it should happen after placing the principal and the class teacher under suspension,” Vinod said. He said the committee would submit report with recommendations to the MHRD and UGC and also the state higher education department and the university. Vinod said the principal was handling the incident in a casual manner and added that it is a lapse on the part of the college that they did not visit the family of the deceased student. Also the family of the student has raised serious charges involving racial discrimination that a teacher asked the student to go to Punjab and write the exam. “The student had a genuine reason for the attendance shortage and the college authorities should have given it due consideration,” he added.

Noting that courts can transfer investigation from a state investigating agency to another like CBI only in rare and exceptional cases, especially if the investigation prima facie is found to be tainted, a division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and R Hemalatha said: “As of now, no such material has been placed before this court warranting transfer of investigation to CBI.” The court can’t issue directions on the basis of mere sympathy or sentiment, the bench said, adding: “Taking into consideration the facts and circumstances as well as the agony of parents, the investigating agency concerned is directed to file their status report before this court as to the progress being made in the investigation by January 22.” The bench made the observations on Friday while dismissing a plea moved by Loktantrik Janata Dal’s Kerala unit seeking a CBI probe into all ‘14 suicides’ reported at IIT-Madras since 2006. “The statistics provided by the government would disclose that between February 2008 and November 2019, a total of 16 students of IIT-M had committed suicide, maybe on account of stress and other related facts and unable to perform to their full potential. It is time the IIT administration makes every endeavour to give periodical psychiatric counselling to the students,” the bench said. Faculty members are under obligation to motivate/encourage students to perform better and permanent solution has to be found as expeditiously as possible to prevent loss of young lives, it said. It is also suggested that such psychiatric counselling should be part of the course in all educational institutions to prevent such incidents of suicide by way of instilling more confidence into the young minds, the court added. In a related development, another division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice N Seshasayee on Friday dismissed a PIL filed by National Students Union of India seeking a CBI probe into Fathima’s death.

Through an editorial written in the party’s mouthpiece, the CPI has flayed the functioning of the police force, referring to a series of recent incidents. While pointing out the incidents from the Monson case to the suicide of Mofiya Parveen in Aluva, the CPI mouthpiece has said there is a lack of trust in the police force when it acts against the interest of society. “Several past incidents have led to a loss of trust in the police force in the state,” it said. The editorial said that it was most unfortunate that those who are to take care of society are not doing it, and it has badly affected the image of the Left government. It was also most unfortunate to note that Mofiya Parveen’s suicide note had mentioned the circle inspector’s name. It cannot be seen as an isolated incident. The same officer had messed up a case earlier also and top police officers were unaware of it. Strangely, the complaint of this law student was not taken seriously by police officials. The editorial also slammed that despite an inquiry report demanding suspension of this officer in the earlier case, nothing happened. This created a bad impression before the democratic society. The editorial further said that it was the duty of a responsible government to handle such situations when police are becoming a bane for society. CPI leader C Divakaran flayed the police force for Mofiya’s suicide. He said when Kodiyeri Balakrishnan was the home minister, he had introduced the Janamitiri Police scheme to create a friendly bonding between police and the people. All such initiatives have lost momentum, he said.

According to the data tabled by chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan early this month, since January 1 last year till September 30 this year, as many as 67,779 complaints were received at the police stations and at the CM's office on charges of physical and sexual harassment. Among them, 64,223 complaints were received at various police stations, while 3,556 petitions were received directly at the CM's office. Of the 67,779 complaints, 64,940 (95.8%) have been disposed of. At the same time, the crime statistics of the police show that as many as 23,783 cases were registered from January 1 last year till September 30 this year in various police stations on the same subject. Surprisingly, this figure is only approximately one third (35.08%) of the total number of petitions received by police and CM's office, raising questions on the legality of the way the remaining petitions were disposed of. The police are already in the dock in the latest case involving the child adoption case and the complainant, Anupama S Chandran, had alleged that her petition was not registered by the police for more than four months. In another case involving the suicide of a law student, Mofiya Parveen in Aluva, she had left the police station in the regret that she may not get justice from the police station where she had come to register a domestic-violence complaint. The figures presented by the CM also say that as many as 3,262 women committed suicide in the same time-span. The chief minister had also admitted that there is a minor increase in the number of women committing suicide.  ""Only one-third of the complaints received from women are materializing as criminal cases would imply two inferences: Either that most of the complaints are not serious in nature, or the police are not seriously considering many such petitions from women.

464,Kochi,[],"Protests mount against cop, Cong demands suspension","Kochi: Inspector CL Sudheer, who was the station house officer of Aluva East police station, has been facing a barrage of criticism over his mishandling of the domestic violence complaint filed by Mofiya Parveen, who died by sucide on Monday night. The law student had sought action against him in her suicide note. On Wednesday, another woman alleged misbehaviour by the police officer. According to the woman who raised the allegation on Wednesday, she was at the police station along with Mofiya. “When she came, I was there. The CI talked to her in a threatening tone. When she returned, she was visibly sad and upset. Had inspector Sudheer taken any legal action to assist her, she wouldn’t have been forced to take this extreme step. His stand towards me was also similar. He had a threatening tone and he addressed me as ‘edi’,” said the woman. The officer seems to be biased as he behaved well with a couple of other women, who looked financially well-off, at the station, she added. The woman refused to reveal the nature of her complaint, citing that she was called for a discussion at the DSP’s office. Meanwhile, opposition parties staged protests outside Aluva police station seeking action against Sudheer, who ironically was at the station where the accused were held, even on Wednesday. Leader of opposition V D Satheeshan said that the officer had CPM connections. The incident was an illustration of the state government’s approach towards women’s security, he alleged. “The officer was protected by CPM leaders even when he was accused of mishandling the Uthra murder case. It is a sad plight that the local MP and MLA have to protest in front of the station to trigger an action against the officer,” he said, adding that harassment of women who go to police stations with complaints has become common in Kerala. Meanwhile, Aluva MLA Anwar Sadat who staged a sit-in in front of the police station throughout the day said that they would not accept anything less than the officer’s suspension. He said that the demand has been informed to Neeraj Kumar Gupta, Ernakulam range DIG. The protest outside Aluva police station had gone out of control. The police and protesting activists clashed and a few activists were arrested and removed from the spot. MP Benny Behanan and MLAs from neighbouring constituencies, Roji M John and Eldhose Kunnappillil had also joined the protests.

469,MUMBAI,[],"Payal Tadvi accused can’t carry on PG studies, but can get licence back","MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday rejected the plea of three doctors, accused of abetting the suicide of their junior Payal Tadvi at Nair hospital in May 2019, to continue their postgraduate studies at that hospital on the grounds that influencing of witnesses cannot be ruled out. Justice Sadhana Jadhav, however, recalled a bail condition of suspension of their medical licences, paving the way for them to practice medicine. She directed that the trial be completed within 10 months after the trial court frames charges, which is yet to happen. Justice Jadhav also directed the Maharashtra Medical Council to conduct an inquiry and take action as per law if doctors Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehare and Ankita Khandelwal are found guilty. The three had approached the HC last October to drop some strict bail conditions and allow them to enter Nair college and practise again. But hospital gynaecology department head Dr Ganesh Shinde categorically opposed their entry. Shinde, appearing after Justice Jadhav sought his assistance in deciding the plea, said: “I took a meeting. I called all students. I could see apprehension in them. Ultimately health services will be affected.” Special public prosecutor Raja Thakare said the ban on the trio’s entry into the college had a “tremendous deterrent effect’’, and if they are now permitted to enter “at least six colleagues of Payal said they just cannot concentrate and complete their education and they have only one year left for post-graduation”. There are almost 50 doctors listed as witnesses, apart from other staff, and they could interact with the others in the common areas and laboratories, he added. Appearing for the doctors, senior counsel Aabad Ponda on Thursday stressed that their right to complete their post-graduation from the same college be protected. But Thakare argued that there is “no urgency” and they could complete it after the trial, which has been ordered to be expedited. To the judge’s question, Dr Shinde ruled out the possibility of the accused doctors taking training in other hospitals to enable them to complete their PG course. The Medical Council of India advocate Ganesh Gole also said migration of students undergoing PG is not permitted. While granting the three bail last August, the judge had, among other conditions, directed them not to leave Mumbai without court nod, to report to the crime branch, Nagpada, every alternate day till framing of charges, not to enter the Nair medical college or the Agripada police jurisdiction, and suspension of their medical licence till the trial ends. Maharashtra Medical Council counsel Rahul Nerlekar said the doctors have replied to its notices, but Ahuja is not enrolled with it as she graduated in UP. The judge said if she registers with MMC in eight weeks, the inquiry can proceed against her too. “In the event they are found guilty, MMC will be at liberty to pass appropriate order under the law,” said the HC on Friday.

The girl was staying alone in Subhanpura after her mother died seven months ago and she reportedly did not get along well with her father. However, she hung herself at her father’s residence in a society in the Laxmipura area of the city. While police started investigations after registering the incident as an unnatural death found the statements out of place and informed doctors that the case looked suspicious. “It came to light that the girl had been staying alone away from her father. She came to her father’s residence only on June 8,” said police inspector R C Kanamiya, who is investigating the case. Meanwhile the father, who had been telling the police all along that he did not know the reason behind her extreme step, revealed that the girl had been raped. The police also found injury marks on the victim’s neck and hand as well as traces of semen on her. Based on investigation, police arrested two of her colleagues — Dishant Kahar and Nazim Mirza — who were working with her in a business process solutions company in the city on Thursday night. Cops unearthed the fact that the girl had been raped after the duo allegedly got her drunk. Cops said Kahar raped her in the presence of Mirza on Tuesday evening. According to case details, Kahar and Mirza came to the victim’s residence to meet her on Tuesday evening. At the same time, another girl Radhika (name changed) was present at the victim’s residence. She left the house initially and so did the two youths. However, a little later the duo returned to the victim’s residence with a bottle of liquor. It has been alleged that the victim was forced to consume liquor by the two after which Kahar committed the crime in front of Mirza. When another friend of the victim, Shivam (name changed), came to her residence, he saw her and informed the father who rushed to the place and took her to his residence. The father told the police that the victim had hung herself at his residence on Thursday morning and it was Shivam who informed him. When the father reached home, the girl was being taken to the Gotri GMERS Hospital where she was declared dead. “He (father) was aware about it, but did not do anything about it fearing that his daughter would get a bad name,” Kanamiya added. Police have recovered an audio recording made by the victim as well as a suicide note that she had left behind. The investigators are, however, tight lipped about their contents and said that this would be released only after investigations reached some stage. The rape and suicide victim used to play kabaddi when she was in school and sources said that she had represented the state too in the sport. However, details in this regard were not available.

Initial investigation revealed that it was due to the pressure of board examinations though no suicide note was found. She had previously failed in board exams and according to officials was under pressure due to which she took her own life. The deceased has been identified Sonu Nayak. SHO Kashyap Singh said, “She committed suicide on Tuesday evening after returning home from giving History subject examination. The prima facie appears to be that she was under academic pressure though it cannot be said with certainty that this was the reason that she took her own life. Last year also she had failed in her board examination.” Cops are yet to ascertain the reason behind the suicide and the official added, “As of now we have no clue as to the reason behind the suicide and even the deceased’s family is unable to give us any idea as to the possible reason for the same. They claim that there was no indication that Sonu was thinking along these lines.” “We will check her mobile phone as well to find clues which led her to take such an extreme step. We will also check her call records to find the person that she spoke to last before killing herself. Hopefully once we get more details, there will be more clarity in the case. We will also question her friends and acquaintances in case they can shed some light on the matter. We are not ruling out any possibilities at this stage,” said the official. The girl was found hanging by her family when she did not open her room door despite repeated knocking.

Mahesh (20), son of Velmurugan of Kozhinjampara in Palakkad district, was a second semester student at the college of agriculture and had returned to the hostel 10 days ago after it reopened following the easing of Covid restrictions. SFI leaders alleged that the student ended his life after he was subjected to ragging at the college. SFI central committee member V P Sarath Prasad said the college campus was dominated by KSU, and that several complaints of ragging have been raised by students. He also alleged that students who have passed out of the college have been still staying in the hostel. The university authorities denied the allegations. The anti-ragging committee of the university had conducted an internal enquiry on the complaints and that it did not find any evidence of ragging at the college campus, a senior official of KAU said. As per the information gathered by KAU officials, Mahesh looked happy on Saturday evening and did not show any signs of depression. “Mahesh was talented in art, and was trying to design some objects using thermocol last evening. His roommate was sleeping when Mahesh ended his life by hanging from the fan,’’ said the university official. According to the university authorities Mahesh had sent a message over the phone around midnight to his friend saying he had done something wrong and was not able to face his parents. The university officials has handed over the friend’s phone to the police. The police officers also said there was prima facie no evidence to link Mahesh’s death to ragging. “The case is under investigation,’’ said ACP Ollur K C Sethu. Psychiatrists have cautioned against the tendency to attribute suicides to a single factor. “Suicides are triggered by a complex set of multiple factors, including the personality and behavioural pattern of the victims, as well as external issues. Explaining suicides in simplistic terms could hamper the efforts to understand the phenomenon and adopt preventive measures based on bio-psycho-social dimensions,” said Sailaja, a noted psychiatrist in Thrissur.

Ludhiana deputy commissioner Pradeep Aggarwal said they were recommending to the government the formation of a grievance redressal committee, which can have parents, teachers, and other officials in it to address grievances concerning private schools. He added that whereas government schools have such a mechanism, private schools are lacking in the facility. Once the private get an NoC from the state government, it is the boards — including CBSE, ICSE, PSEB etc — which have a say in such schools. “If we have such a mechanism in case of private schools, their grievances can be addressed, and regular monitoring can be done,” the DC said. The district administration said they were asking the district education department to get Parents-Teachers Meetings (PTMs) organised on a class-wise basis in the school, get the time-table restructured as per board guidelines, monitor its implementation, and hold orientation programmes for teachers. The DC said they were asking the district education department to arrange a special counselling for Dhananjay’s classmates, for which they had already arranged counsellors.

The complaint turned out to be a rumour after the girl turned up and issued clarifications in the evening. But students had till then held protests, accusing the university management of a ‘cover-up.’ At 9.20pm on Tuesday, some students called up cops after they came to know that a blood-stained cloth had been found in hostel room number 120. They feared that a girl had ended her life after she was gang-raped outside the campus. The students were not known to the girl, they started demanding the student be produced before them.Police reached the university with an ambulance. After conducting an investigation, they confirmed it was a misunderstanding and no such incident took place. Cops left the campus at 11.30pm. On Wednesday, the rumour spread, with an addition that the management was trying to cover up the case by bribing the police, prompting a large number of students to gather on the campus and demand an explanation from the authorities. Despite repeated announcements made over a public address system, the students refused to believe the authorities. As many of the students were not known to the girl, they started demanding the student be produced before them. By this time, the girl who was away to take her quarterly exam returned to the administrative block and addressed the students, following which the protests were called off. Dr Neelam Verma, deputy dean, student affairs, said the girl had recently got married. She said the girl had plucked out some pimples from her face and left the blood-stained cloth in her room. “The fact that she had gone to take her exam and left her phone and books in the room fuelled the rumours as she could not be found by others.” The university issued a statement claiming it was a ‘prank’. “Some students made aprank call to the police, which was investigated and found incorrect. Cops have recorded statements of two students who admitted they called the police,” the university said. Their parents were called to the university and they regretted the development, Verma said. However, no action was taken against anyone.

The questionnaire also has a question if they faced any abuse through social media and mobile phones besides asking them if they need any counselling to clear their confusions.Unlike previous attempts to sensitize minor girls about sexual crimes, perpetrators and existing laws to protect them, the new scheme took a novel approach with the district administration led by collector Dr T Prabhushankar meeting school children and striking a conversation with them.The district administration has enumerated 26,085 children from classes 9 to 12 in 201 schools in the district. Instead of making it as a school education driven programme, as the children may not open up, the district administration chose 20 officers from different government departments to head each one team. Each team will cover five schools daily for the next two days.“We wanted to reach out to girls and instil courage in them. We targeted the most vulnerable population among them,” collector Prabhushankar told TOI. It may be pointed out that a Class 12 girl from a school in Karur committed suicide alleging sexual harassment on November 19. She did not reveal the identity of the perpetrator of the crime.The teams will distribute a handbook with the messages in Tamil elaborately discussing recent incidents of child sexual abuse in a school in Coimbatore, good and bad touches, perpetrators, ways to report the incidences, bring the abusers before the law and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.“The objective of the scheme is to ensure safety of girls.

The music teacher had written a very detailed suicide note along with complaint letters to the district collector, magistrate and the SP. The relatives hope that the police will initiate a probe based on the letter’s content. Anil, a relative of the deceased said that they will wait for a couple of days for the police to initiate action. “We will move legally if there is no action by police,” he said. Meanwhile, Vaikom CI said that they will probe the issues raised by Babu in the letter. Babu, 51, an Arattukulangara native, was found hanging from a tree near his house in the premises of a volleyball court, on Thursday morning. He was a music teacher in an Ettumanur school. Several handwritten papers were pinned on to the net of the volleyball court in which he had explained his innocence. He had also displayed the complaint by the students. “He was unable to face people after serving 45 days in jail. He was a popular artist,” said Anil. Three school staff, including a woman, were behind framing him as an accused, he added. None of the complaints by 14 students and two parents had anything to do with sexual abuse, Anil said. The woman was instrumental in making the students file complaints, he added. “The complaints were strange: the teacher calling one student ‘chetta’ (elder brother) always, catching hold by the collar of the shirt, laying his palm over that of the student while using a computer mouse, making one student sing in class always, raising one of the eyebrow, etc,” said Anil.

502,Agra,['16-year-old'],Allahabad HC raps SIT over probe in rape-murder case of schoolgirl,"Agra: The Allahabad high court (HC) has expressed displeasure with the speed of investigation in the case of the death of a 16-year-old student in Uttar Pradesh's Mainpuri back in 2019. The girl was allegedly raped and found hanging inside a prominent governmentresidential school building. The court aired its dissatisfaction after the state government submitted the status report of the case earlier this week which suggested that DNA samples of 170 suspects have been taken and sent to a laboratory for testing. The results are yet to be received. The court ordered the director general of police (DGP) to appear in person in case the DNA test reports are not in by October 25, which is the next date of hearing. On September 17, the government had announced a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to take over the case after the court pulled up the UP police for being careless with the probe. The DGP had admitted to serious lapses in investigation. He had informed the court that semen was detected on the victim’s underwear during lab tests, but the investigation officer did not send it for DNA testing within 45 days, as mandated. This would have helped match the sample with that of the accused named in the FIR as well as of other suspects. Earlier, TOI had reported that the new SIT investigating the case had collected blood samples of the suspects, including that of the son of a UP cabinet minister. A reward of Rs 1 lakh was also announced for those who came up with leads in the case by ADG of Kanpur zone, Bhanu Bhaskar, who is heading the new SIT. The case was initially believed to that of suicide. However, an FIR was subsequently registered against the school principal, hostel warden, and a boy from the arts stream with charges of murder and attempt to rape, based on a complaint filed by the girl’s father. Rape charges were added after the post-mortem report found clotted blood in the vagina and a torn hymen.

503,Ludhiana,[],Industrial hub records max suicide cases in region,"Ludhiana: Ludhiana has achieved yet another dubious distinction by recording the highest number of suicide cases in the region (Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir) in 2018. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, Ludhiana witnessed 194 suicide cases in the year. While Chandigarh registered 160 such cases, Faridabad had 149, Amritsar 66 and Srinagar 12. Of 194 suicides here, ill health accounted for most of the cases — 140. Of these, 97 were men, 42 women and one transgender. Seven students, including four girls, committed suicide due to failure in examination. As many as 60 people ended their lives due to family problems. Poverty drove eight people, including three women, to give up on life. Four men took the extreme step due to alcoholism and drug abuse. Unemployment and property disputes, too, claimed four lives each, the reports shows. The grim figures present another worrying trend — an upswing in cases over the years. The industrial hub recorded 54 such cases in 2013; 126 in 2015; 147 in 2017 and 194 in 2018. Psychologists say suicides triggered by illnesses mostly have a mental health issue as the underlying factor. “Such a number of suicides is not because of physical illnesses, but mental problems. It occurs when a person fails to meet his aspirations. Medical facilities try to suppress illnesses with medicines and fail to handle psychological causes. This increases hopelessness. Ludhiana being a business city, families don’t have much time for each other. And nowadays, whatever time they have, they are glued to gadgets. There is, therefore, not much face-to-face communication,” says psychologist B P Mishra.

According to officials, suicides among minors has been increasing in the district and just two months into the new academic year, seven students under 16 years have committed suicide. In July, five students in Idukki ended their lives. From June 2020 to July 2021, 25 child suicide cases have been reported in the district. The child protection officials said that they prevented many suicide attempts among minors during the lockdown period. District child protection officer Geetha M G said that under the child protection unit, a group, including members of women and child welfare department, vocational higher secondary, higher secondary, Samagra Shiksha Kerala (SSK), education department and district panchayat, will be formed and counselling will be provided to families and students. “Our primary inspection found that suicide among vulnerable families and students in the district is increasing. The panel will identify vulnerable families and students in the district and provide direct counselling,” Geetha said, continuing, “To provide counselling, we have given training to teachers in the district. Consultant psychiatrist Dr C J John provided training to the teachers, and over 400 teachers in the district attended the digital training session.” Dr John revealed that the condition of students in the district is quite alarming. “Students and parents in the district need emergency counselling to prevent suicides. In the training session, the counselling methods have been shared with teachers,” he said. Geetha further said that they plan to provide child-friendly sessions online to reduce the stress among students. “In many suicide cases, parents question children’s failure to attend online classes. This is a factor. Especially in plantation and farming sectors in Idukki, parents are not aware of how to handle online education-related issues,” she said. “Another probelm is that outside students illegally join online classes through the shared links and makes abusive comments against teachers and students. Such incidents took place in Kumily and Thodupuzha. In some cases,vulgar links were shared in the school groups,” Geetha said. Apart from suicides, sexual abuse incidents have also been reported in Idukki. In one such incident, two boys, aged 13 and 14 years, sexually abused two minor girls. In January, a 14-year-old girl was found pregnant after being sexually abused by a16-year-old boy who is also her relative.

In the first incident, Jajzlan Kazi, 21, who was a second year student of MBBS at Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital (IGMCH), hanged himself from a hook on the wall in his study room at his Ayappa Nagar residence on Thursday. This was the second case of suicide by an MBBS student in the recent past. On Friday, the atmosphere at the IGMCH mortuary was emotionally charged with classmates and teachers offering their condolences to Kazi’s relatives. After returning from namaz in the afternoon, Kazi went straight to his room around 2pm and took the extreme step, a relative told TOI. Kazi’s father Jawed Hussain, a lab assistant at a college in Gandhibagh, said, “I left for work in the morning and after that, went to IGMCH to deposit Kazi’s fees. As the clerk was not in his seat, I went home and learnt that Kazi is in his room since afternoon. I knocked at his door, but he didn’t respond. I peeped from the rear window of his room and saw something suspicious. My wife thought that he was sleeping but I insisted that the door be broken and when we did that, we found our son lying dead. I still can’t understand why he took such a drastic step. He should have at least spoken to us if he was going through any problem. My son was a bright student.” Kazi’s last rites were performed on Friday in the presence of his family, relatives and friends.

He attributed his success to the constant support from his parents.  Wali said students should not give up, if they failed to score well in exams. “Though they must make honest efforts while writing exams, results are not everything in life. I had scored 73% in Class 12.” He advised parents to play a key role in children’s life. “If a child scores poor or even fails in exams, that does not mean he/she is a permanent failure. In such cases, parents should come forward to help their children and motivate them for the future,” said Wali. He asks parents to have proper communication with their wards. He said parents start comparing after watching hoardings put up by coaching classes glorifying the students who secure high marks in exams. “They start asking their children to be like those toppers. This is where the problem starts. It instills the fear of results among students. Family and friends should help such students to cope with situation,” said Wali. He advised that parents should go for counseling to help such students. “I have seen that even counseling has been a taboo subject for several parents despite observing odd behavioral pattern shown by their children. They feel that counseling is for those, who have some kind of metal health issues. A normal person can also have problems, so parents should never be afraid of counseling, if it is required,” he said. According to Wali, parents should keep a close watch on their children whenever results are announced to see changes in their behavior. “Parents are the best people to sense if anything is wrong in the behavior of their children,” said Wali.

Experts say the word 'sorry' repeating itself is an indication of a 'distressed mind'. The eighth grader of La Martiniere Girls' College appeared to be revising her French lessons just before the incident. On the top of the page that contained the note of apology, a few French words - 'Je seus (sic)' and 'La vendeuse de (sic)' - were also written with a blue pen. She perhaps wanted to write 'Je suis (I am)' and 'La vendeuse (the saleswoman)'. Although preliminary investigation has not pointed to any foul play, police are not treating the note as one of suicide either. ""We need experts to confirm a handwriting match first. The note will be examined in the forensics lab,"" Husainganj station house officer Anil Kumar said. Mental health experts say while the note does not categorically reveal what Shibani may have been so apologetic for, it does reflect the distressed state of mind of the student if she indeed wrote it. ""Writing the word 'sorry' repeatedly indicates that one is very sensitive and genuinely feels bad about something. At that particular moment, the person who wrote it felt she does not deserve to live,"" said child psychologist PK Khatri. Khatri stressed that children without siblings to share emotions with often find themselves in a similar dilemma. Nurturing a death wish is not rare in such a situation.

It was observed that there was no remarkable change in the results of the students after re-verifying. Failed subjects remained failed after re-verification too,” the TSBIE said on Sunday. While the suicides have been attributed to technical errors in declaration of results on April 18, the Board’s analysis of the answer scripts of 25 students (22 suicides and 3 attempted suicides) has found that 10 failed in one subject, 12 failed in more than one subject and three committed suicide despite passing the examination. In one case a student committed suicide despite scoring 85% and ‘A’ grade. In another case the fear of failure got the better of a girl who killed herself after writing the third paper thinking that she would fail — she in fact had passed in all subjects she attempted.

517,HYDERABAD,['18-year-old'],"Telangana inter results: Student suicides high among BC, SC & ST communities","HYDERABAD: On April 23 this year, Ch Naveen Kumar, an 18-year-old second-year Intermediate student belonging to the SC Madiga community hanged himself from a tamarind tree in an agriculture field in Yenkepally village of Pudur Mandal in Vikarabad district of Telangana after he failed in the mathematics exam. Naveen’s father Ch Nagesh is a driver and his complaint with police stated that his son failed in three subjects. Analysis of data provided by the Telangana State Crime Records Bureau (SCRB) by TOI revealed that like Naveen, most of the Intermediate students who committed suicide following failure in exams belong to SC, ST, BC communities, poorer sections and from families living in slums, tribal hamlets and villages. Out of 42 Intermediate students who ended their lives in the past five years, from 2015 to 2019, in Telangana, around 80 per cent of them belong to Scheduled Caste, Schedule Tribe and Backward Caste communities. The total number of suicides increased over the years. While the number of Intermediate students who ended their lives was five in 2015 it increased to 15 in 2019 as per official statistics. The death toll due to failure in exams is the highest in 2019. Social scientists believe that illiteracy among parents, lack of acceptance of failure and struggle for finances could be the key reasons behind the high suicide rate among socially and economically backward classes. Dr Vinita Pandey, assistant professor of sociology in Nizam College of Osmania University, who had done research on student suicides, told TOI, “Students in Telangana are stuck in the rat race of results at Intermediate level due to competition among corporate colleges. There is more pressure on Inter students than degree and PG, particularly in MPC and BiPC groups due to additional baggage of them having to appear for Eamcet and IIT entrance test. In socially and economically underprivileged families, students are not sensitised to accept or handle failures. The biggest challenge of parents is economic survival and when their sons or daughters fail, it brings a shock value.” SCRB records show that out of 42 students who ended life in the last five years, 24 were girls and 18 boys. “Despite outperforming boys in Inter exams, girls are more vulnerable emotionally. Though there is no exhaustive research on it, parents tend to get the girls married when they fail. Due to fear of early marriage, most girls go into depression. Girl students from minority communities often tell us that they will be married off if they fail in exams,” said Vinita Pandey. The maximum number of Intermediate student suicides were reported from slums of Hyderabad and rural and semi-urban belt of Cyberabad and Rachakonda police station limits while the Secunderabad railway police district accounted for many cases where the students jumped in front of trains and ended their lives. G Surender, an electrician belonging to the Padmashali BC community living in Chilkalaguda of Hyderabad, has lost his daughter Keerthana three years ago as she committed suicide for failing in first year Intermediate exams. Surender says, “Keerthana was studying Inter in Vignyan Bharathi Junior College. My son also failed in Intermediate and I made him appear for supplementary exams and he passed later. I joined him in degree college but he couldn’t pursue his studies and now works with me as electrician. I told my daughter at least she should study. I worked hard to fund their education. However, she hanged herself on April 24, 2016 after she failed in the exam.” Prof N Purendra Prasad, head of the department, sociology, Hyderabad Central University, says, “There is no study done on this. But, so far, what was stated by several people is that structural conditions existing in the society are primarily responsible for suicides. Aspirational mobility among the lower classes to be part of larger kind of employment and beset by problems of access to quality education could be the reasons.” ",30-04-2019,"['failed', 'complaint', 'failed', 'suicide', 'failure', 'poorer', 'death', 'toll', 'failure', 'lack', 'failure', 'struggle', 'suicide', 'backward', 'stuck', 'failures', 'fail', 'shock', 'vulnerable', 'fail', 'fear', 'depression', 'fail', 'limits', 'lost', 'suicide', 'failing', 'failed', 'hard', 'failed', 'beset', 'problems']"

While one of them died a day later on March 2 in hospital, the other youth passed away on Friday night after battling for life at the Government Rajaji Hospital for 13 days. The youths were part of a suicide pact involving one more youth who however did not resort to the extreme step. Police said the deceased youths, both 18 years old, hailed from Ahimsapuram and Bibikulam while the third was from Aruldosspuram. They were first year BA Economics students at the Thiagarajar arts college at Vandiyur Mariamman Teppakulam. The youths were very close and used to move together on the college premises. Distraught at being made “fun of” by classmates, the three of them pledged to take poison at the same time. On March 1, they bought fruit juice, mixed poison in it and left with a share each. Police said while two of the youths consumed it at the ‘pre-scheduled’ time, the third youth developed cold feet. One youth was found unconscious frothing at the mouth on March 2 in his house at Bibikulam. His parents immediately shifted him to a hospital, but doctors declared him brought dead. The youth from Ahimsapuram was rushed to hospital the same night. “He came home around 10 pm on the night of March 1 and went to his room straightaway. Later, his mother heard vomiting sound and went to check on him. She found that he had consumed poison and rushed him to Government Rajaji Hospital,” a relative said. The relatives of the youth were inconsolable in front of the GRH on Friday when the news of his death came. Tallakulam police had recorded a complaint from the boy’s mother in the community service registry (CSR) on March 4. In her complaint, the woman said that the trio was forced to take the extreme step due to frequent teasing by their classmates led by a boy from Thiruppuvanam.

523,HYDERABAD,[],Pressure-cooker exam system shadowing future of students,"HYDERABAD: While stress resulting from a rigorous academic structure is being looked at as the trigger behind suicides by students at premier institutes like in the case of Siddharth Pichikala, academicians have offered a different perspective. They say that it is not the IITs by themselves but the long hours put in by students to crack the entrance exams which stunt their ability to deal with challenges which may arise later in their lives. Academicians are of the opinion that aspirants, when they are around the ages of 15 to 17 are forced into study shifts, some as long as 17 hours a day which is doing them more harm than good. “I don’t believe the problem is with the IITs. It is more or less the society and pressure cooker entrance preparation by junior colleges in the state. Inter students do not indulge in sports or other activities which are very important for mental development and stress relief,” said IIT-H guest faculty, Ramesh Loganathan, adding that when mental growth is stunted between ages 15 and 17, it will have a deep impact on students. Others have argued that mental health of a student is ignored in our education system. Students are made to believe that their qualities are entirely dependent on their grades. They said that while institutes cannot make wholesome changes to their academic structures to accommodate students who may have fallen behind, they can increase vigilance and ensure that students get help when needed.

The girl’s family has alleged that the principal not only scolded their 15-year-old daughter, but also slapped her in front of the whole class. He called her parents and asked them to take the girl out of school, they said in their complaint to police on April 14. The girl was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room on April 9. Her uncle, the complainant in the case, said that around 11.30am on April 8, the girl’s parents got a call from the school asking them to meet the principal immediately. The principal complained to them that their daughter was ill-mannered because she did not bother to clip her nails before coming to school, was wearing long earrings and also carrying a cellphone with her. The principal allegedly told them that the Class X girl would be removed from school. After the girl returned home, she neither had lunch nor spoke to anyone. The next day, her parents went to meet the principal again. They had taken along the girl’s younger brother, who studies in Class IX in the same school. “The principal got angry seeing them again. This time, he complained against both the children (the girl and her younger brother) and asked them to be removed from school. My brother tried to reason with him that they had given the girl a phone because she needed it for her online classes. But he was in no mood to listen to my brother. The principal then asked them to leave his office,” the uncle said. The principal, however, reminded the parents that they should clear all fees before pulling the girl out of school, he added. When the parents returned home, they told the girl they would plead with the principal again and sort out the issue. “They tried to pacify their daughter. She listened to them but did not utter a word. After a while, she went back to her room on the first floor. When she did not come out after a while, her younger brother banged on the door, but there was no response. They broke open the door and she was found hanging with her dupatta,” the uncle said. The family members rushed her to a private hospital in Sector 57, where she was declared dead on arrival. Later that evening, the principal visited her house to pay his condolences and was accused of driving her to take the extreme step. Over the next two days, many of the girl’s classmates visited her house and corroborated that the principal often misbehaved with them. “Some of the children told us that he had even slapped our daughter for keeping long nails and a cellphone. The phone was given to her for online classes. She did not ask for it. They made such a huge issue out of it,” the uncle said. The family approached the police on April 14 and filed a complaint against the principal. The next day, a case was registered against the principal at Bhondsi police station under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code. “We are investigating the case. No arrest has been made till now,” police spokesperson Subhash Boken said. The school in Ghamroj has classes from I to XII.

In the first case of organ donation by a suicide victim, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and eyes of this brain dead girl were given for transplantation in needy patients in Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmedabad, on Thursday. Nandani Shah, whose parents run a beauty parlour in Halal town, was admitted to the city-based Savita Hospital on December 19 after she consumed poison. She breathed her last on Wednesday evening. “Nandani was brought in a serious condition. She underwent treatment for five days, but we couldn’t save her. After brief counselling by doctors, her family agreed to donate her organs,” said Dr Tarang Sharma, medical administrator, Savita Hospital. Dr Pranjal Modi, convenor of State Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (SOTTO), said, “This is the first instance of organ donation from a suicide attempt with poison consumption. We were apprehensive about the liver getting affected by organophosphorus compound. But we could successfully retrieve the organs as they were not affected by the poison.” This is the first time that heart and lungs have been donated in Vadodara. The heart has been taken to AIIMS , Delhi and lungs to a private hospital in Mumbai. It will take some time to match the recipient’s blood samples with the donor’s organs to decide in whom they will be transplanted. Her liver was transplanted into a 55-year-old man who was suffering from organ failure while the eyes were given to Baroda Medical College. “This has opened a new direction in organ donations as the majority of them from the accident or fall victims or those in medical settings,” said Dr Modi. “When the doctors declared my daughter brain dead, we were traumatized. But after some discussions within our family and with the doctors, I decided to donate her organs,” said Krima Shah, who was inconsolable. On Thursday, the city police made a green corridor to ensure that the organs reached the airport quickly. Nandani was a student of VM School in Halol and was a brilliant student. “She always wanted to become a beautician,” said Krima. “I had decided to donate my vital organs and help the needy after my death. But I never thought that someday I will have to donate my daughter’s organs. I pray that those who receive Nandani’s organs live a long and healthy life,” she added.

536,CHANDIGARH,[],Unequal footing: E-Lessons fail students’ test in Punjab,"CHANDIGARH: Forced by Covid-19 pandemic to stay away from schools, students are struggling to cope up with remote education, which is fast becoming the new norm. All the schools in the state are shut since March 13, and will remain closed till further orders, disturbing the academic schedule and activities. To make up for lost teaching hours, the Punjab education department has been pushing for e-learning by making efforts to reach to students through different mediums. The multimedia-based e-content of the prescribed curriculum for pre-primary to senior secondary classes, designed by teachers, is being shared on WhatsApp groups. Teachers also share assignments, quiz and other information related to studies with the students through these groups. Soft copies of the textbooks have also been uploaded on the state education board website. However, lack of internet connections, smart phones and computers, has emerged as a major hurdle for students, especially from economically weaker sections (EWS). There have been reported three separate tragic incidents of students committing suicide apparently for not being able to attend online classes for want of smartphone. While opposing the guidelines issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) directing universities and college to conduct final year examination, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh recently acknowledged that a large section of the students in Punjab, especially in rural areas and among the backward communities, did not have access to “affordable and uninterrupted internet connectivity”. National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) survey on ‘household social consumption: education’ has pointed out limited access of the internet, especially in the rural areas. Only 9.4% of households in the rural areas of Punjab have computers, while 39.4% have internet connectivity. The urban areas are relatively better placed with 26.7% of households having computers, and 57.1% having access to the internet. In rural areas, 42.46% have mobile internet subscribers, as per data of Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). General secretary of master cadre Washington Singh said the e-content was regularly being shared with the students on WhatsApp. “However, a big chunk of students do not have smartphones and those who do are facing net connectivity issues,” he said. Sharing his experience, Gurpreet Singh, press secretary of Teachers’ Democratic Front (Digvijay Group), said he started online classes for his students on Zoom but was forced to discontinue after two weeks due to poor response. “Out of 60 students, only four were attending the class and they also stopped after a while due to resource constraints,” said Gurpreet. The tragic incidents of three students killing themselves for not being able to attend online classes for want of smartphones has made parents panicky and they have started taking loans from microfinanciers to purchase internet enabled phones for their wards, he added. Those lucky enough to have resources to access e-content are struggling to cope up with the absence of the classroom experience. Jasanpreet Kaur, a student of Class XI, rued, “The teacher-student connection is missing and learning becomes difficult when there is no interaction between student and teacher. Right now, students are on their own.” The Right to Education Act mandates 800 instructional hours in an academic year in the primary section, and 1,000 hours in the secondary section. There are over 26 lakh students enrolled in about 20,000 government schools. Punjab education secretary Krishan Kumar said Covid-19 outbreak had led to unprecedented circumstances and despite that the department had been making all out efforts to reach out to the students through all the available options, both online and offline. “Besides delivering the learning content through online mode, the students are being taught their lessons on television and radio,” said Kumar.

A division bench of Justices Ranjit ore and Bharati Dangre recently quashed an FIR filed after the student from Dehu Road committed suicide by jumping into a quarry. The principal and four teachers had been booked for abetment of suicide after the parents of the deceased student blamed them. The student had jumped to his death after he was suspended by the school authorities for allegedly beating up his classmate. ""Having gone through the FIR, there is absolutely no material to show intention on the part of the (principal and teachers). There is nothing to show that they abetted or instigated the deceased student to commit the suicide,"" said the bench. ""It is unfortunate that the young boy committed suicide. However, (the principal and teachers) cannot be said to be responsible,"" said the judges and ordered that the FIR should be quashed. The court was hearing a petition by principal Sojan Puthenparampil John (55), physical education teacher Fattesing More (52), Hindi teacher Shradha Pathak (36), Maths teacher Pratibha Tomar (37) and English teacher Bindu Kumar (46) challenging the FIR filed against them. Advocate Aniket Nikam contended that there was no material furnished by the police to show that the principal and teachers had intention to instigate the student. The HC agreed. ""The offence of abetment involves mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, the person cannot be compelled to face trial,"" said the judges. ""It is necessary for the prosecution to at least prima facie establish that the accused had an intention to aid or to abet the deceased to commit suicide. In the absence of availability of such material, the petitioners cannot be compelled to face trial under section 307 of IPC,"" the court said. On July 4, while returning from tuitions the student jumped off a cliff. In his suicide note, he said the teachers and principal were responsible for his death as they had suspended him and made him sit outside the staff room.

After reviewing the spot, we think that the student rode his motorcycle at high speed in the Mutha ghat section and drove it over the railings of the road before plunging into the valley,” Dhumal said, adding, “He was the only child of his parents.” He said after falling into the valley, the student might have lost his consciousness and his motorcycle might have caught fire. According to the Airport police, the student was pursuing his studies at a private polytechnic college in Wagholi. “On January 20, he attended his morning classes. He informed his classmates that he was going to Regional Transport Office (RTO) in Pune for some work and left the college around 12.30pm,” the police said. The student used to return home by late afternoon usually. When he did not return home till evening on January 20, his family members started searching for him, but to no avail. They then filed a missing person’s complaint with the Lonikand police before approaching the Airport police. “The Pune city police tracked down his location on January 25 after he sent a text message to his father. They then informed us about his location, following which our team reached the spot,” Dhumal said. “We will conduct an inquiry later on to ascertain the reason behind the suicide. For now, we have registered a case of accidental death in this regard,” he said.

The girl is currently bed-ridden due to the multiple fractures she suffered. In its notice to the Gautam Budh Nagar SSP, dated August 26, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has said it has taken note of the incident as there has been a violation of Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act (cruelty to the child at the hands of someone having the the actual charge of, or control over, a child). “Kindly initiate proceedings in the case under the section and submit an investigation report within 10 days,” reads the notice, a copy of which is in possession with TOI.

560,Nagpur,['10-year-old'],Aug sees 38 suicides so far. Are rising Covid-19 cases to blame?,"Nagpur: Is the coronavirus pandemic pushing people, particularly the young, into a mental health crisis? It can’t be mere coincidence that a rise in coronavirus cases has also seen a spike in suicides in Nagpur city this month.From January 1 to July 31, the city police recorded 255 suicide cases (average 37 cases per month). But 38 people killed themselves between August 1 and 13. These 13 days have also seen a massive spurt in coronavirus cases. Interestingly, compared to previous year, the overall number of suicides has actually fallen compared with the previous year’s cases.Though investigations are underway and the reason behind several suicides is yet to be ascertained, many have ended their life due to stress, unemployment and financial distress, evidence collected by the city police indicates.Evidence indicates the Covid-19 pandemic has psychological and social effects. At least five saloon owners from city have died by suicide as the coronavirus outbreak snatched away their livelihood. Lockdown and restrictions in economic activities also left several people, particularly the working class and youths, with mental health issues.This year, due to the coronavirus outbreak, the pass percentages of students in boards and universities examinations were more. So the numbers of dejected students endling life reduced drastically. But many minors killed themselves over trivial issues like a 10-year-old boy from Gittikhadan area over eating fast food, while another teenage boy doing so over mobile game. Experts feel the Covid-19 pandemic may increase prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Social isolation, drop in social interaction, and the fear caused by the pandemic — all glaringly evident — are likely to increase suicides, said city psychologist and counsellor Anushka Karira. Another major factor is lack of anger management, she said.According to the city police in calendar years 2018 and 2019, there were 680 and 635 cases of suicides respectively. Thus in 2019, each month saw and average of 53 suicides in 2018, the figure was 57 per month. Thus this year’s average of 37 cases per month is low. In April, the suicide cases witnessed a steep decline at just 11.The figure started increasing in May which saw 28 suicides. In June, there were 49 cases while in July they rose to 66. This month in just 13 days, the city has seen 38 suicide cases. So while suicides were low during lockdown they have spurted during unlockdown along with rise in Covid-19 cases.In most cases the deceased were “fighting helplessness, fear and uncertainty”, said a senior cop, who noted this had become a prevailing condition since the Covid-19 pandemic struck, bringing with it long lockdowns and economic misery.Year---Suicides2018---6802019---6362020 ( up to July 31)---2552020MONTHS---SuicidesJan — 38Feb — 30Mar — 33APR — 11May — 28Jun — 49Jul — 66",15-08-2020,"['crisis', 'suicide', 'killed', 'fallen', 'stress', 'distress', 'died', 'suicide', 'outbreak', 'outbreak', 'dejected', 'drastically', 'killed', 'trivial', 'issues', 'suicide', 'isolation', 'fear', 'glaringly', 'lack', 'anger', 'suicide', 'steep', 'decline', 'suicide', 'helplessness', 'fear', 'struck']"

562,MUMBAI,['69-year-old'],"50 years after caste persecution, two renowned doctors speak out","MUMBAI: Caste unfortunately counts in medical schools and public hospitals, show articles written by former students of the reputed state-run Government Medical College in Nagpur in the recent issue of an indexed medical journal. “I am still afraid to visit my so-called alma mater,” wrote 69-year-old Dr Himmatrao Bawaskar in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics (IJME). Bawaskar had graduated from GMC Nagpur in 1975 and has since gained worldwide recognition for antidotes against certain scorpion and snake bites. His piece talks of groups formed on the basis of caste, about being unfairly marked during exams and seeking treatment for depression that included a month-long stay with a faith healer as well as 10 sessions of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Experts say that 50 years on, caste is still an issue in Maharashtra’s medical schools. Dr T P Lahane, who heads the Maharashtra department of medical education and research (DMER), gets letters from students across the state complaining about “caste-based discrimination”. “It is certainly less than it was in the 1970s, but it hasn’t disappeared,” said Dr Lahane. ‘Caste in medical schools’ talk came out in the open after resident doctor Payal Tadvi committed suicide in her hostel room at Nair Hospital, near Mumbai Central railway station, in May. Her family alleged caste slurs and harassment by seniors drove her to take her life. Dr Lahane said most caste-related complaints came from medical students in Nagpur, Pune and Aurangabad. “Mumbai is better, making up for barely 10% of all caste complaints,” he said. The most common complaint—similar to the one described by Dr Bawaskar 50 years ago—was that external examiners usually gave the so-called lower caste students low marks despite them getting good scores in written exams. “When I appeared for the final MBBS examination, I topped in the surgical viva and written test. My internal examiner was very impressed with my performance, but the external examiner was from the Brahmin community,” wrote Dr Bawaskar. He told TOI his name that had “Rao” as a tag gave away the fact that he was not a Brahmin. “Despite my good performance, I was given low marks,” he said. Dr Bawaskar’s letter was in response to a piece by Dr Anurag Bhargava that appeared in IJME’s edition dated June 18. Dr Bhargava wrote, “Late into my first-year MBBS, I came to realize that caste was a defining characteristic in this medical college.” He highlighted how two classmates who hailed from the tribal community suffered—while one who had done manual labour could not cope with medicine and starved himself to death at a local temple, the other student, a girl, was a target of verbal barbs at her lack of sophistication. Dr Bawaskar suffered also because of his “poor English”. “I tried to avoid communication and participation in group discussions. I could not even find a friend in my peer group. Eventually, I suffered depression during my second-year MBBS,” he said. He remembers how a professor once rebuked him saying, “Hey psycho! Don’t talk!” during his turn in a group discussion. He was so affected by the Nagpur experience that he refused to take PG admission in GMC Nagpur. He took up a medical officer’s post at a primary health centre in Konkan before finishing his postgraduation from B J Hospital in Pune. Dr Bawaskar said he avoided getting his son admitted into a medical course in the OBC category reserved seat because of his own suffering. “Reservations should be based on economic status and the caste column in the school certificate should be deleted,” he averred.

569,HYDERABAD,[],Furnish report on suicides of Telangana Inter students: MHA,"HYDERABAD: The union ministry of home affairs (MHA) has sought a factual report from the Telangana government on the suicides of 27 intermediate students following the board of intermediate education’s (BIE) errors in the declaration of public examination results. In response to a petition filed by state BJP president K Laxman with the President of India seeking justice for the families of the students, the MHA directed the chief secretary of Telangana to submit the report immediately. “As the issue raised in the petition concerns the state government of Telangana, it is requested that factual report in the matter may please be furnished immediately by fax or email,” read the notice issued by the office of MHA. Speaking to TOI, Laxman said that at least now the state should respond and initiate action against the erring officials. “It is time for the state government to own up to their mistake and pay ex-gratia of Rs 25 lakh each to the families of those intermediate students who committed suicide because of the board’s mistake,” said Laxman adding that a delegation from BJP went to the President’s office in July and filed a petition. The state BJP chief added that it was disheartening to see intermediate officials responsible go scot-free. “Both education minister of the state and the BIE secretary should be sacked and a criminal case should be lodged against Globarena Technologies Pvt Ltd, which was handling data and result processing for the board,” he said. After the board released the results of IPE examination in of April 2019, massive protests erupted across the state alleging that several students failed in the examination due to the board’s mistake. The board was forced to re-verify results of over 3 lakh students by the Telangana High Court free of cost and over 1,000 students, who had initially failed in the exam, were declared passed after re-verification. A committee formed to look into the blunder submitted a report which found both board and Globarena guilty. However, no action has been initiated against either parties involved.

Following the fresh lead, Jigani police have converted the unnatural death case into a case of abetment to suicide. V Pavitra, 21, a final year LLB student of University Law College, Jnanabharathi, Bangalore University and resident of Koppa Gate, near Jigani, hanged herself in her house on October 23.

572,BENGALURU,[],"One every hour: At 10,335, last year saw most student suicides in 25 years","BENGALURU: In 2019, at least one student died by suicide every hour in India. The year recorded the highest number of student suicides, 10,335, in the past 25 years for which data is available. Between January 1, 1995 and December 31, 2019, India lost more than 1.7 lakh students to suicide. Of these, nearly 52% were reported in the past decade, while the remaining 85,824 were reported between 1995 and 2008, according to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). Both sociologists and psychologists TOI spoke with said depression, mental health issues and addiction to drugs were the most common reasons. Dr MS Dharmendra, consultant psychiatrist, Manasa Neuropsychiatric Hospital, told TOI: “Coping mechanisms and support systems are important. Biological factors like genetic predisposition to mental illnesses also play a role. A person with a higher level of predisposition may go on to develop a clinical illness which can become a risk factor for self-harm or suicide. It depends on how they are able to handle stress.”   While 2019 saw the highest number of student suicides in absolute terms, this category accounted for 7.5% of overall suicides (1.39 lakh), which is marginally less compared to 7.6% in 2017 which saw 9,905 cases. However, the overall number of suicides in 2017 was more than 7% lower than in 2019. A statewise analysis in 2019 shows that just five — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh — account for more than 44% of 10,335 student suicides that year.   Child rights activists also point out that many students, especially those above the age of 10 or 12 years, struggle to find avenues to vent their anxiety, which makes stress management difficult. Between 1995 and 1999, student suicides accounted for more than 5.2% on average, with 1995 (6.6%) being the worst year. In five years between 2000 and 2004, only one year saw student suicides making up 5.5% of the total suicides, while it was under 5% in four years and 5% in 2001. From here, the next five years also saw such cases being under 5.5%. Between 2010 and 2014, the last two years saw such cases make up more than 6% of the total. From there, every year has seen such cases account for more than 6%. In the past four years, such cases have accounted for more than 7% of the total suicides.

579,KOCHI,[],Jishnu Prannoy committed suicide: CBI chargesheet,"KOCHI: The CBI team probing the death of Jishnu Prannoy, a student of Nehru College of Engineering and Research, Pampady in Thrissur, submitted chargesheet before Ernakulam CBI court stating that the student committed suicide. The CBI also invoked suicide-abetment charges against college vice-principal N K Sakthivel and assistant professor C P Praveen. The chargesheet stated that no evidence was found against Nehru Group chairman P Krishnadas, who was earlier arraigned as an accused by state police crime branch. Prannoy, a first-year BTech student at the college, was found hanging in his hostel room on January 6, 2017, hours after he was reportedly grilled by teachers for engaging in malpractice during an exam. Initially, state police and crime branch had investigated the case, arraigning five people, including Nehru Group chairman P Krishnadas as accused in the case. They have been charged with abetment of suicide, forgery and criminal conspiracy. But, Prannoy’s family had demanded that murder charges should be slapped against the accused. Following this, the state government had written to the Centre to recommend a CBI probe into the case. When the petition came up before the Supreme Court in November 2017, CBI took the stand that it was not ready to take over the investigation. CBI’s counsel had told the court that the case did not warrant an investigation by the agency as it lacked inter-state issues. The agency also cited its workload to turn down the request of the state government. But later the SC directed the CBI to take over the case. Parents to move SCParents of Prannoy have said they will approach the Supreme Court against non-inclusion of Nehru Group chairman Krishnadas in the chargesheet filed by the CBI. Prannoy’s mother Mahija said the CBI should have investigated who was behind the move by the college management to raise false examination malpractice allegations against Prannoy and added that such a move would not have taken place without the knowledge of Krishnadas. “The CBI should have subjected Krishnadas to polygraph tests if the agency could not find evidence against him. “It was the Supreme Court that ordered a CBI enquiry into the case and we will approach the SC, pointing out lapses in the CBI investigation,” Mahija added.

Police said the autopsy would be held on Monday and added that the method, though unconventional, had been reported in the past as well. They suspect that the girl could have found the method online or from movies and a probe has been initiated in this regard. Suicides are preventable and help is just a phone call away.

587,THIRUVANANTHAPURAM,[],Kerala: ‘Causes unknown in several suicides’,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: A majority of children who committed suicide in the state between January 1- July 31 this year were in the age group of 15-18 years and among them, 66% were girls, said a report that analysed details of 158 children who killed themselves during the period. At the same time, boys accounted for 61% of the children who committed suicide in the age group of 9-14 years, according to the report prepared by a committee led by DGP and commandant general of fire and rescue services R Sreelekha. The analysis unveiled a range of factors for the suicides, some of them busting popular conceptions. The reasons for several instances of suicide seemed so trivial like wanting a cycle, fight for TV remote, sibling rivalry and getting scolded over spending too much time on mobiles. Four children committed suicide over sibling rivalry while 19 killed themselves after parents scolded them. In 41 cases, the reason remained ‘unknown’. Alarmingly, many of the children under this category were considered active and smart. Other reasons which drove them to suicide include failure of love affair and addiction to mobile games and internet. Twenty four children had mental health issues. The study debunked the notion that academically brilliant children would stay away from taking such an extreme step. As many as 50 children who committed suicide were good in studies. Among them, one had received a President’s award, another was a class leader and yet another one a student police cadet. Only 29 fared poorly in their studies. “Teachers and parents never addressed issues of active or smart children, assuming that everything is good as they excelled in their academic and extra-curricular activities,” the report said. The report said most parents were not able to identify the mental health issues faced by children. Indicators like place of committing suicide, time and type of family when read together, show a lack of inadequate support systems within the family.

588,MANGALURU,[],Karnataka athlete suicide case: Verdict expected on October 30,"MANGALURU: Judge CM Joshi of the Principal District and Sessions Court, Udupi is expected to pronounce the judgement in the sensational Prathvi S Poojary suicide case on October 30. The pronouncement of the judgement was deferred on Thursday. Providing details about the case, advocate Ravikiran Murudeshwar recollected how Prathvi S Poojary, a national level athlete, from Amparu village in Kundapur taluk was a promising athlete. He said, “As a student at Sanjay Gandhi High School she was very good in javelin throw. She used regular sticks for practice instead of javelin due to its non-availability. She was very much interested in the sport and her throw was excellent."" ""Soon after completing her SSLC, she received two offers for PUC- from Alva’s College, Moodbidri and Brahmhavar Sports Club came forward to sponsor. She was admitted to SMS College in Brahmhavar and stayed in the college hostel comprising of 22 inmates with Divya Poojary, her relative and athlete hailing from the same village as her roommate. Everything went really well during the first year of her course,” he said. During the second year, she came in touch with Misban, 22, a former student of the college who was also the sports secretary. He had gifted her a mobile phone. Despite ban on the use of mobile phones in the hostel, she would secretly use it and Misban would also get in touch with her through a cook, said Murudeshwar. However, differences grew between the two and this became public during a sports meet, where he reportedly pulled her bag and the physical education director had to intervene. He warned Prathvi not to get bring personal issues on field. At the dasara sports meet held in Mandya, she secured the second prize in javelin throw and third in high jump. On September 27, 2011, she reportedly celebrated her success by dancing in the hostel, but around 1pm, committed suicide by hanging herself in the hostel room. IPS Officer Ram Niwas Sepat who was then ASP Puttur headed the investigation. She was being trained by two coaches of national repute. Soon after her death, the police found her mobile phone. Her father and uncle complained against her coaches, hostel warden and college management (without naming anyone) doubting harassment. “The police then found her diary in which she held Misban responsible for her death. She wrote that he is a stupid boy and that she hated boys. In a few pages, she said that she never loved Misban and he had threatened to come to her hostel. She did not want to live with him. Handwriting expert Ashwathappa has given his opinion before the court, “said Murudeshwar. Meanwhile, Misban had not called her during the last three days before her death, but there were text messages in which he threatened to reveal their relationship to her family. In her diary, she expresses anguish against hostel mates and hostel staff, said Murudeshwar. He told the court, “Her diary is not maintained as diary, but she has used is as note book. She has not written her feelings in an organised way (date-wise) hence we cannot conclude what was her state of mind before her death”. Misban was booked under section 306 (Abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code and has been released on bail. The court has examined 25 witnesses and marked 27 documents. Public prosecutor in the case is Shanti Bai.

This is the third case of a student killing himself on IIT-H campus in the past eight months. The latest incident comes at a time when the IIT Council, the highest policy-making body of the premier institute, is discussing ways to reduce suicides among its students.

595,Thiruvananthapuram,[],"Take prompt action in cases of atrocities against women, kids: Police chief","Thiruvananthapuram: Amid criticism about the way the police have dealt with several social issues and crime cases in recent times, a high-level meeting convened by state police chief Anil Kant here on Friday discussed various issues and solutions for better policing. Addressing senior police officials from the rank of SPs and above, the state police chief said that the district police chiefs have a major role in ensuring effective policing on the ground. He said that the police officers should ensure to dispose of the petitions relating to atrocities against women and the SC and ST categories. In complaints relating to domestic violence, the police should conduct a probe immediately without fail, said Anil Kant. The initial police inaction in the case of Anupama Chandran in the capital, citing it as a family dispute, had cost the force heavily. The behaviour of the members of the force while dealing with the public was also a point of discussion in the meeting. The latest instances of severe criticism from the high court against the Pink police and the suicide of a law student in Aluva after visiting the police station, have come as a huge embarrassment to the force as a whole, despite repeated instructions to police officials from time to time for behaving politely with the public. Stressing that investigations into Pocso cases should be completed in a time-bound manner, the state police chief said that the district police chiefs should ensure to provide all necessary records in the cases that are under trial. He said that police should make their presence felt on the roads in the mornings and evenings and should also ensure that night patrolling is effectively undertaken. The police chief asked the officers to take prompt and quick action in petitions received online. The meeting also reviewed the expenditure of the Plan funds and the funds for modernization of the police force, and also took stock of the various ongoing constructions and projects. The progress in community policing initiatives, including Janamythri, student police cadets and the Kadalora Jagratha Samithis, were also reviewed in the meeting. It is for the first time in the last almost two years that a meeting of top police officials is being convened physically at the state police headquarters.

597,NEW DELHI,[],Close connection between social media updates and suicidal thoughts: IIIT-D study finds,"NEW DELHI: There is a close correlation between suicidal tendencies and social media posts, according to a research by Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) Delhi. The study found that most people with suicidal thoughts post their views on social media and so the institute has developed a neural network which can identify over 80% of “at-risk tweets” on Twitter and other social media platforms by assessing the language used by the users. Researchers from Midas Lab at IIIT-D have developed an advanced artificial intelligence which can identify words and sentences on social media that hint at suicide or suicidal thoughts. Ramit Sawhney, who worked on the project, said initially they asked clinical psychology students to assess over 34,000 tweets and identify if they were suicidal in nature. “This was done to look for key words like ‘kill myself, ‘end my life’ etc. The students were asked to mark it as suicidal if they found the tweets as such. There was 88% agreement between students on what was suicidal,” Sawhney said. The IIIT researcher informed that the same was fed into a neural network. “We used software that even Google uses in its search engine. The software was taught about language and how keywords can help find associated words.” Professor Rajiv Ratan Shah of IIIT-D said that their research focused on building natural language processing system to identify potential suicidal intent in social media messages to provide support to “at-risk users” in an automated fashion without any human interference. The Suicidality assessment Time-Aware Temporal Network (STATENet), developed by them, can identify over 80% of at-risk tweets on Twitter. Shah said, “Recent studies showed that people exhibiting suicidal ideation make frequent use of social media to share their mental state, disclosing their suicidal thoughts and plans. This makes it essential to automatically flag at-risk posts to extend support.” Sawhney said they are now looking to collaborate with University of California to improve mental health. “Currently Facebook and Twitter sends messages of suicide prevention helpline or other texts in case if the keywords written by a user explicitly suggest suicide. But it is not effective as it doesn’t identify the language as our neural network does. We are developing a model that can be picked up by social media companies,” he added.

601,MUMBAI,[],Payal Tadvi suicide case: Crime Branch seeks custody of three accused doctors,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai Crime Branch on Tuesday approached the Bombay high court, seeking custody of three senior doctors of a civic hospital arrested for allegedly abetting the suicide of a junior colleague. A special court had last Friday remanded the three doctors - Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehere and Ankita Khandelwal - to judicial custody till June 10. The Crime Branch's petition, seeking their custody for interrogation, will be heard on June 6, the prosecution said. The trio, attached to the B Y L Nair Hospital here, was arrested last week on charges of abetment of suicide of their junior colleague, Dr Payal Tadvi. After Tadvi ended her life on May 22, her family alleged that the accused doctors taunted and hurled casteist abuses at her as she belonged to a scheduled tribe. The accused were subsequently booked under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Anti-Ragging Act, Information Technology Act and section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The suicide case, which triggered a wave of protests, was later handed over to Mumbai Police's Crime Branch from the local Agripada police. The Crime Branch, in its petition in the HC, said it was handed the case on the day when the three accused were remanded to judicial custody and hence, did not get a chance to interrogate them. The petition challenged the special court's order sending the three accused to judicial remand and pleaded with the HC that they are sent back to police custody. As per the Crime Branch plea, custodial interrogation was required to ascertain if the victim had left any suicide note and if the accused persons destroyed it. ""The petition was mentioned today before a single bench of Justice S S Shinde which has posted it for hearing on June 6,"" public prosecutor Deepak Thakare said. The trio had Monday filed bail pleas before the special court, which will hear them on June 10. Of the three doctors, Mehere was arrested last Tuesday evening, while Ahuja and Khandelwal were taken into custody by the police in the early hours of Wednesday. In their bail applications, the three have claimed that they never made any remarks on Tadvi's caste and were in fact not even aware of her caste. They further claimed that they had only pulled up Tadvi for doing a ""poor job"" in the hospital and had not harassed her as alleged by her family. Tadvi (26), a post-graduate student at Nair Hospital, hanged herself in her hostel room as she was fed up of being allegedly harassed by the three accused.

But on the night of December 13, the vendor and his wife had come to the neighbours’ house. When the mother objected to it the accused humiliated her and her daughter in front of everyone, following which they took the extreme step. In Haibowal suicide case, not only the teenage girl, but her mother also could not face the humiliation and chose to end their lives. In another incident reported on March 31, 2019, a 14-year-old attempted suicide by consuming phenyl in Dugri, who was allegedly harassed by her father and step mother. However, the girl was saved after the FIR was lodged against the accused duo. The stepmother had provoked the father to beat up the girl, following which the girl took the extreme step. On March 6, 2018, a 16-year-old boy of Jeevan Nagar of Moti Nagar had allegedly committed suicide by hanging self in his house following the pressure of his relatives to marry a minor girl whom he did not like. Moreover, after getting the news of his suicide, the minor girl also jumped off the second floor of her house, however, she survived with several injuries. Dr Anshu Gupta, a psychiatrist, said, “Teenagers are too sensitive to handle stress and relationship issues. In addition, when they don’t get a communication channel to share anything or feel their parents are not friendly, they build up everything in their mind and take the extreme step. It is high time that the elder members leave traditional parenting as children these days are too sensitive. Parents have to listen to their children and create a friendly environment at home.” Further, Dr Gupta said, “For the children whose parents are not open minded or not educated enough to give a friendly environment, the administration or the health department should come up with a free suicide prevention helpline number. In majority of the foreign countries, they have suicide prevention helpline numbers.” “Besides, it is time to add the stress handling subject in the school and college curriculum.” ",14-01-2021,"['depressed', 'issue', 'strained', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'shocked', 'suicide', 'harassed', 'suicide', 'died', 'died', 'objectionable', 'complaint', 'suicide', 'humiliation', 'suicide', 'harassed', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'stress', 'issues', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'stress']"

607,JAIPUR,[],"Timely treatment, care can curb suicide cases: Experts","JAIPUR: Suicides can be prevented if friends and relatives can identify the person who is under severe depression. Proper treatment and care can save precious lives, say experts. “A lot of patients come to us saying that they do not want to live, they do not have any worth, they have a sense of guilt. If we see 100 patients daily of depression, 50 of them say that they do not want to live. Among those, 10-15% are those who have already made suicide attempt by consuming sulphas or rat killer. But, if they are provided with proper treatment and care, they can overcome such feeling that they lead a normal life,” said Dr R K Solanki, head of the department (psychiatry), Psychiatry Centre, Sawai Man Singh Medical College. However, the psychiatry specialists claimed that there are various environmental factors which drive a person to commit suicide such as failed love affair, problems related to family and workplace, breakdown of a relationship, financial constraints and health issues. “Someone somewhere loses his life to suicide in every 40 seconds. Every year, about 8 lakh suicides take place worldwide, whereas, for every suicide there are many more people who attempt it. It is estimated that against one suicide, there are 20 attempts. Among men, suicides are higher in numbers in comparison to women, but among women suicide attempts are higher in numbers comparing to men. According to National Crime record Bureau, five persons per lakh commit suicide per year in state,” said Dr Akhilesh Jain, head of the department (psychiatry) ESI Model Hospital. He said that there is a well-established link between suicides and mental disorders particularly depression and alcohol-linked disorder. “Suicide may happen impulsively in the moment of crisis but there are warning signs of suicide which could be helpful in preventing such attempts. Majority of such patients have diagnosable mental disorders and such type of behaviour is more common in psychiatric patients,” he said. The psychiatry specialists claimed that there are incidents of students committing suicide, who remain under pressure to perform. They claimed that parents should frequently communicate with their children and understand their mental condition to prevent such incidents.

Rahul (15), a student of the La Martiniere Boys College, had fallen to death from the 60-feet tall Constantia building on the school campus on April 10, 2015. Disposing of the case, the apex court issued the directives on a petition filed in 2017 by Rahul’s brother, Rohit Sridhar, who informed the police that Rahul was in touch with one ‘Larry Conners’ through the internet and investigators have not been able to trace him. He said ‘Larry Conners’ might have a role in Rahul’s death. “We are not averse to issuing a direction to the SIT to find out Larry Conners. If some information is forthcoming in that direction, the SIT would pursue that as there is no other aspect on which we can issue any other directions to the SIT,” the order said. “The SIT would endeavour to conclude this aspect as early as possible. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team under the ministry of electronics and information technology will render whatever assistance is required,” the order added. The petitioner had raised several objections to the probe conducted by the SIT, which was formed on the directions of the SC in 2019. Following the objections, the court issued an order on November 2, 2020 regarding the constitution of another SIT to conduct a fresh probe. The counsel for the victim, Alok Singh, told TOI that Rahul was being misguided by a person, ‘Larry Conners’, as it appears from virtual chats on Facebook. “He was not acting on his own volitions but was under influence,” he said, adding that Lucknow police got details from Facebook, including email IDs and IP addresses, but did not act on the details and the investigation met a dead end. A week after his death in 2015, his parents filed a murder case against unidentified persons. However, in its final report submitted to the trial court, police termed Rahul’s death a suicide. In February 2016, the family challenged the report in the court of the chief judicial magistrate who ordered a reinvestigation. Next year, the family moved the high court and sought a CBI probe but HC directed the police to conclude investigations. The family was forced to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court.

Within 24 hours of MP board results declaration, six students committed suicides in the state earlier this week leaving parents, educationists and state government worried. Vice-Chancellor, Dr BR Ambedkar University of Social Sciences, Prof Asha Shukla said success should not be based upon passing or failing in exams. “Parents compare their children with those, who perform well infusing inferiority complex among them,” said Shukla, adding, “Students should be encouraged for studies, but we also need to accept their failure.” “Many people failed in exams, but achieved huge success in their later lives due to the support and motivation from family, especially parents,” said Prof Shukla. NGO Spandan conducted a research in 2017 based on police records, phone calls received by them and the NCRB data of the last three years. “We collected NCRB data of last few years and compared the number of phone calls and police cases in MP. Keeping the base figure of 2014, we calculated that the rate of suicides has gone up. According to the latest NCRB report, around 2,500 teenagers committed suicide because of peer pressure and fear of failure in the last five years,” said Maya Bohra, founder, Spandan. Several cases of runway children after failure in exams are also reported in the state every year and the number is rising.

""It has been over two months since the incident took place but neither an investigation into it has been initiated nor any other action has been taken. I urge you to please direct the authorities to take up the matter and start the probe so that truth can be brought to fore,"" she said. Priyanka pointed out that the girl’s family has raised doubt over the administration and school authorities several times but to no avail. ""It is there right to know what happened with their daughter. Who was behind her death? Is the administration trying to shield someone? There are many more important aspects which emphasise the need for an unbiased detailed probe in the case,” she wrote. Stating that it was very important to take the case to its conclusion in the interest of UP’s daughters, their freedom and right to education, Priyanka also drew UP CM’s attention towards some important points related to the case. ""There were injury marks on the girl’s body at the time of the inquest (panchanama) while no marks were listed in the post-mortem report… Then, the girl’s body was disposed of in a river in the absence of her parents,"" she stated emphasising that the case must be probed. Former Union minister and Congress Jitin Prasada had also paid a visit to the family of during his Brahmin Samman Yatra. ""There are many loopholes in the case which must be investigated so that justice is not denied to the family,"" he said. UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu claimed that if UP government continues to ignore the matter, the party will launch a campaign to press for an investigation in the case.

621,AGRA,['22-year-old'],KD Medical College student kills self in Mathura institute's recreation room,"AGRA: A second-year student of MBBS in Mathura’s KD Medical College was found hanging inside the institute’s recreation room on Thursday night. However, no suicide note was found from the spot. According to police, the student identified as Anjali Yadav hailed from Mainpuri and had been missing since Thursday morning. Initially, her roommate looked for her at every possible place where she could go. After failing to find her, she immediately informed the college’s hostel warden. Anjali’s mobile phone was found in her hostel room below her bed’s pillow in vibration mode, said the police. The warden subsequently informed Anjali’s family, the college administration and the police. While searching the campus, someone noticed that the recreation room’s door was locked from inside. When the room’s glass window was broken, her body was found hanging inside the room. Anjali’s parents had also reached there by then. Her body was taken out and sent for post-mortem, said the police. Chhata circle officer, Jagdish Kali Raman, said that according to Anjali’s batchmates, she was upset as she had not performed well in the examinations and was scared about the impending results. He said that could be a possible reason for her to take the extreme step. He, however, said that more would be known after the post-mortem. “Police will act if something is found suspicious in the case,” said the CO. Talking to media persons, Anjali’s uncle Brijesh Yadav said that he received the information about his missing niece from her roommate on Thursday evening. “I was surprised that no one from the administration or the hostel informed the family immediately and waited for 18 hours,” said Brijesh, who arrived in Mathura last evening. Yadav claimed that the last time Anjali spoke to her mother was around 10:15 pm on May 9. Since then, there was no interaction with her. When contacted, Manoj Agarwal owner of KD groups, refused to comment on the matter. In October 2016, a 22-year-old student of the dental college, owned by the same group, had committed suicide in his hostel room. The deceased was a resident of Itanagar and was a third-year student. In June last year, a first-year student of Bachelor of Dental Surgery in KD Dental College, Anushka Kashyap (22) was found hanging inside her hostel room.

The minor boy had allegedly hanged himself at his house on August 26. Police said the woman has been booked for threatening the boy over phone, which apparently drove him to take the extreme step. The deceased boy and the son of accused and another friend, also a minor, were addicted to playing ‘Free Fire’ mobile game on their smartphones and they spent around Rs 50,000 on App purchases from the account of the accused woman’s father-in-law. When the woman learnt about it, she called the deceased and gave him a nice dressing-down. Police registered a case against the accused woman under relevant sections of IPC and The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Investigation officer, SI Rinku Jatav said the deceased Ayush Chadhar, 15, son of Dayaram Chadhar, a resident of Baba Nagar in Shahpura, was a student on class 8 and the only son of his parents. Dayaram works in a private company. Dayaram told police that he along with his wife had gone to their flat in Salaiya where some renovation work was in progress on August 26 and on return, found Ayush hanging in the room. Dayaram told police that his nephew told him that before taking extreme step, Ayush had told him that he received a threat call on his phone from his friend’s mother Sumanlata Rathore and he seemed depressed. No suicide note was recovered from the spot. Police registered a case in the matter and started investigations. SHO Shahpura CK Patel said that during investigations it was learnt that Ayush along with his two friends including Sumanlata’s son used to play online ‘Free Fire’ mobile game on his smartphone. Sumanlata’s son knew about his grandfather Madanlal’s UPI account. So, the boys using Madanlal’s account spent around Rs 50,000 on in-App purchases on ‘Free Fire online App’. When Sumanlata learnt about it she got angry and reprimanded Ayush and the other friend. Ayush received her call himself, while the other boy’s parents received the call the same day. Patel said that Sumanlata admitted that she had called Ayush before the incident. So, police have registered a case against her and further investigations were on.

""The principal and teachers don the mantle of a parent during the time the child is in school. Like a parent, who would - and is expected to - admonish a child who errs with the intention of correcting the child, so are the principal and teachers expected to admonish and chastise students when they transgress discipline of the school,"" Justice Atul Shridharan said in his order.  The girl, a resident of Kotma town of Anuppur district, had committed suicide on November 14, 2017 after being scolded and allegedly slapped by principal R K Mishra, who had seen her with two friends outside the school before classes got over. She hanged herself after recounting the punishment to her uncles.  Her family tried to file an FIR against the principal under section 306 of Indian Penal Code (abetment to suicide), but they refused. An uncle then moved court, saying his niece committed suicide out of humiliation as the principal had ""slapped and scolded her in the presence of two friends"". On Friday, Justice Shridharan said: ""It goes without saying that the days of 'spare the rod and spoil the child' are long gone, but it does not mean that the principal and teachers of a school languidly watch and ignore acts of indiscipline and indiscretions of a child. Correction by way of admonishment and chastisement, as and when required, remains a sacred duty of those imparting education... Behind every person languishing in prison as a convict are a man and woman who failed as parents and a system of education that could not transcend the three 'Rs'.""  Stressing the importance of drilling good values in students, the judge observed: ""Brilliance without integrity and character is a social and national liability rather than an asset. Schools must emphasise this. Admonishment and chastisement may form an integral part of that exercise. Yes, in the process, it may be natural for the child to feel embarrassed or humiliated, but it is these very emotions that would prevent the child from repeating the mistake.""

On the other hand, local BJP MLA has raised the issue of “fake encounter” with state government. Kadir’s uncle Basit Ali, who is also a BJP leader and currently a member of UP Urdu Academy, has also slammed police. Meanwhile, protest of Chaudhary Charan Singh University (CCSU) students against the encounter entered third day on Monday. Scores of students held protest at a park outside Commissioner’s office in Civil Lines area. The sit-in protest received a shot-in-the-arm after BKU leader Rakesh Tikait joined the gathering urging police to open an “impartial probe” in the case. Kadir, claimed to be a member of ABVP, was injured in an alleged encounter with police in Meerut on Thursday, hours after he surrendered at city’s Civil Lines police station in the presence of his uncle, a local BJP leader and a few other elders who wanted to “save him from police bullets”. SSP Sahni had said then, “Kadir surrendered at Civil Lines police station. He was later taken to recover the gun used in the firing incident on campus on August 28. But, the accused suddenly snatched the gun of a sub-inspector in a bid to escape. He was overpowered but not before an encounter, in which he was shot in leg.” However, his family members questioned the SSP’s version. Unfazed by the allegations, SSP Sahni rewarded Prashant Kumar Mishra, the SHO involved in the crackdown, with a “good entry in his service record.” Kadir’s uncle Basit had asked, “If Kadir wanted to flee then why did he surrender in the morning?"" Soon after the encounter, a video footage of Kadir, purportedly being taken away in a police van after his surrender, was also shared on social media. On its part, police claimed that Kadir was spotted with a gun harassing students at canteen in CCSU premises on August 26 for which a case was registered. His name again cropped up in the sensational shootout at the varsity campus on August 28, in which two students were shot at. The students were part of a group which was supposed to welcome UP minister Ashok Kataria during his visit to the campus.

639,NOIDA,[],Dacoity-murder charge on 5 of 8 arrested for attack on 25-year-old BTech student,"NOIDA: Nearly four months after the fatal attack by carjackers on Amity student Akshay Kalra, Sector 58 police have filed a 35-page chargesheet in the case naming eight people, including a man arrested earlier this week who was in touch with a Haryana-based car dealer to sell the victim’s Hyundai Creta. The chargesheet, which was filed on Thursday, includes a case diary of 800 pages and more than 40 pieces of evidence, including CCTV footage and call records of the accused. The seven accused arrested in October included five members of a Ghaziabad-based gang, Kuldeep alias Happy, his brother Vikas alias Vicky, their cousin Sonu, Shamim and Ajay Rathore, apart from Shamim’s brother Naseem and his friend Vasukinath Tiwari. While Naseem and Tiwari have been booked under IPC sections 412 (dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity) and 120-b (criminal conspiracy), the five gang members have also been charged under Section 396 (dacoity with murder). On Monday, the eighth accused, Ravi, was arrested and booked for criminal conspiracy. Police said Ravi, who operates mainly in Meerut, and his friend, Gulab Jaat, a native of Karnal, both dealt with sale and purchase of stolen and looted cars. Ravi had recently provided three cars to Gulab, including an Endeavour and a Swift. When Gulab stayed in Ghaziabad’s Aditya World City society, he shared a flat with Vasukinath Tiwari. Ravi was their neighbour. “Tiwari contacted Ravi for selling Akshay’s Creta and he, along with Shamim and Naseem, went to Meerut in a Xylo to strike a deal. A trap was laid and their movement tracked. The accused were identified from one of the CCTVs in the area and Ravi was caught a few days ago,” additional DCP (Noida) Ranvijay Singh told TOI, adding that Gulab was supposed to purchase the vehicle for Rs 1.3 lakh but later said he would give only Rs 1 lakh. Sector 58 station officer Anil Kumar said Gulab’s name will be added to the chargesheet once he is arrested and his role is established. Kumar added that Ravi had been booked for abetment in 2018 after his former girlfriend died of suicide. “The woman’s husband had alleged he had been harassing her even after her marriage to him, leading her to end her life. He was arrested by Meerut police and was out on bail,” he said. Akshay, 25, was chased by the carjackers after he left home for a late-night drive on September 2. When he tried to escape from the gang which forced him to stop his vehicle, he hit his head on a divider, resulting in serious head injuries. One of the men then hit him with a brick, according to police. Akshay succumbed two days later at a hospital.

642,BHUBANESWAR,[],Bhubaneswar records more suicides this year than 2019,"BHUBANESWAR: The number of people committing suicide has gone up this year compared to the last two years in Bhubaneswar. While 224 ended their life in 2018, 220 people took the extreme step in 2019. This year, 229 committed suicide by November 30, information shared by the commissionerate police revealed. Psychiatrists are of the opinion that the outbreak of pandemic and months of lockdown and shutdown, clamp down on night life, loss of job and uncertainty, people confined to the four walls of home and lack of outdoor activities induced extra stress. They feel that high levels of stress might have induced people to think of extreme steps. There should be proper study to ascertain that if the pandemic was a possible reason for the rise in the number of cases. According to the statistics, more than 20 suicides have taken place every month till November 30. Barring January, February and March, the suicides were calculated from April when the nation was under lockdown. Police are yet to share the December figure. If an average 20 is added to 229, then it could be 250 in the entire year. Shree Mishra, assistant professor, department of psychiatry in AIIMS, said the Covid pandemic has given rise to mental health pandemic. “Routine life was hugely compromised. Fear, loneliness and anxiety prevailed in the air. Joblessness and salary cuts left people worried about their future. The pandemic has impacted small businessmen, students, homemakers, children and labourers,” she observed. Namita Mohanty, professor of psychology in Utkal University, said lack of social interaction and living amid uncertainty left many people depressed. “Hope is very important for long life. People became hopelessness as they had never experienced such restrictions in their life. That is the reason many might have thought of the extreme steps,” she said. In 2020 till November, the execution of non-bailable warrants (NBWs) was been low as police had to be deployed for the enforcement of Covid. This year, 248 NBWs were executed compared to 498 in 2019 and 603 in 2018. As many as nine illegal fire arms related cases have been registered and 21 persons arrested.

644,CHENNAI,[],IIT-Madras student's suicide: Cops again question three professors,"CHENNAI: Sleuths from the central crime branch of the Chennai police on Wednesday questioned three professors of IIT-Madras in connection with the suicide of Fathima Latheef, a student from Kollam in Kerala who committed suicide on campus on November 9. The professors were summoned before a team led by additional commissioner of police C Eswaramurthy. The inquiry proceedings were videographed to ensure a fair probe. The CCB officials refused to divulge details saying they do not want to prejudice the investigation into the case, which has generated a lot of heat in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Earlier, Chennai police commissioner A K Viswanathan had visited the IIT campus and spoken to the three professors. The local police too had spoken to them before the case was transferred to the central crime branch unit on November 11. Sources in the CCB said the forensic laboratory in Chennai is yet to complete its analysis of Fathima's mobile phone, which is suspected to contain a note accusing some faculty members of IIT-M of ill-treating her. Several students organisations have been staging protests saying they suspected that Fathima, who was an academic topper, was a victim of Islamaphobia. Fathima's father Abdul Latheef, who met Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami and top police officials in Chennai, had wanted to be present during the forensic examination of her mobile phone, but this was not permitted, said police sources. Forensic officials refused to comment on the reasons for the delay in their investigation. Soon after Fathima's body was found, her mother had told the press in Kollam that she had been targeted by a professor because of her religion. Later, her father had backtracked on the Islamaphobia charge, but demanded a thorough probe. Following pressure from students, IIT-M has agreed to set up a committee of experts to study the mental health of students and suggest ways to help them combat pressure.

646,KOLKATA,"['11-year-old', '10-year-old']","Suicide case: Non-acceptance by peers likely to have hurt her, say experts","KOLKATA: Lend an ear to your children’s grievances. Identify their problems and help them solve them. Keep them happy and make them understand that life is priceless and beautiful: these were the messages from psychologists to parents and teachers a day after a Class VI girl, Shrestha Dey, ended her life, apparently failing to cope with a fight with her friends over lunch money at school. “Parents and teachers should not be impatient, they must give time to children and allow them to express themselves. Once they understand what the kids are worried about, they should teach them how to overcome the problems. Most importantly, children must be happy at home. A happy mind appreciates the beauty of life and seldom thinks of giving up,” said psychologist Indira Roy Mandal, attached to a city school and deals with child psychology every day. Discussing the fate of the young girl from Behala, she said, “For children her age, friends are often more important than parents. So, when she found non-acceptance among her peers, it possibly hurt her much more than a rebuke from her parents or teachers would have.” Neuropsychiatrist Sabyasachi Mitra said that till a few years ago, most 10- 11-year-olds believed in “reversibility of death”, as though death was like sleep from which one could wake up to regular life. “But with changing times, child psychology seemes to have changed. Now, even a 10-year-old knows the dead cannot return to face a humiliation,” Mitra said. He also felt the change—particularly in this girl—was possibly brought about by constant exposure to internet and TV. “The girl was possibly undergoing a severe mental turmoil following the spat with her friends and rebuke by their parents. On one hand, there is genetic vulnerability as her cousin had also committed suicide and on the other, there was shame over her inability to pay for food, and the possible retribution from the principal, should the guardians took up the matter with her. All the factors — biological, psychological and social — were at play and that led to this incident,” Mitra said. Psychologist Jay Ranjan Ram pointed out no matter how much depressed the girl might have been, she seemed sure about what she was doing. “For a girl her age, it is difficult to kill oneself. It can’t be an impulsive act. It required certain degree of planning. The way she executed the death and wrote a suicide letter, it is a difficult task for children this young,” he said. Ram added though suicide among young adults was on the rise, pre-pubertal suicide was still rare. “Children don’t take rejection lightly. The degree to absorb rejection differs from one to another. Those, with access to other mediums or people to vent, can overcome the state. But others, at times, end up taking their lives, like this little girl,” he said.

However, a senior officer with the Nadapuram police said that similar allegations were made during the initial investigation as well. “We have opened a reinvestigation. We will be questioning those who are connected to the case again. The autopsy report had not suggested any such foul play, which is why it was closed as a case of suicide.

The family suspect that crucial evidences were destroyed by the accused. Sakshi Gupta, a resident of Fazilka in Punjab, was found hanging in her room on July 17. An FIR under Section 306 (Abetment of suicide) was registered against five senior residents at Lal Kothi police station based on her father’s complaint. Sakshi’s father Somesh Gupta told TOI that the case has been in doldrums since then. “The police investigation has been slow and inactive. There is enough evidence to indicate that my daughter was compelled to take the extreme step after she was harassed and intimidated. We have phone call recordings of conversations where Sakshi narrated her ordeal,” he said. Somesh Gupta added that investigation should either be handed over to another agency like CID, or conducted under the supervision of a senior city police official. “I suspect that crucial evidence were destroyed by the accused to shield themselves. Only an effective investigation would reveal the truth,” he said. The family members said that harassment of junior doctors is an open secret at SMS hospital. “Sakshi was a brilliant student. She knew how to overcome challenges and pressure. But the senior doctors made her feel insignificant. She was forced work overtime. Even while she was suffering from fever and pain, the senior doctors told her to undertake their shifts,” he said, adding that Sakshi’s classmates have also concurred that senior doctors passed their shifts to juniors. The family members alleged that when Sakshi was found dead inside her room the five accused doctors not only tampered with the evidence but also claimed that they did not fear police. “The police have not even investigated Sakshi’s suicide note was destroyed by the accused,” he said. The Lal Kothi police station had examined Call Data Recordings (CDR) of Sakshi’s mobile phone in July last week. The subsequent report showed she spoke to her parent multiple times in a day.

Sneha Chaudhary (20), a second-year of BA (psychology) student, was found hanging in her room in Delhi’s Chilla village on April 7. While the family members initially did not lodge a complaint, they later filed one with Delhi Police on April 16, demanding an FIR be lodged against another youth studying in the same university, whom she knew for the past three years. However, the FIR was lodged on June 21, after the student’s father, Sumant Chaudhary, complained to the DCP (east) district. Now, Sumant has alleged that despite an FIR being lodged, there has been no progress in the probe so far and demanded that the youth’s name be included in the FIR. In their complaint to Delhi Police’s brass, dated July 12, Sumant has complained about the role of the SHO and the investigating officer in the case, alleging the duo demanded Rs 2 lakh from him for viewing WhatsApp chats on the youth’s phone on May 2. He has further alleged that on May 9, the SHO demanded Rs 10 lakh from him for lodging the FIR. According to Sumant, soon after his daughter’s death, they met Sneha’s friends who informed them about her alleged relationship with the youth. After learning of it, Sneha’s parents asked Delhi Police to inquire into the incident. “My daughter’s friends informed me that soon after her death, the youth whom she knew deleted all the photographs on his Snapchat account that they had together with each other. They raised a doubt over him and shared his mobile number,”Sumant told TOI.

The protesting students have blamed one of the professors from the mechanical engineering department, who they said was “academically strict,” which caused the victim to take the extreme step. The incident took place on Saturday, when the institution was closed. The victim has been identified as Anand Pathak, 20, who hails from Maharashtra. He jumped off from the mechanical department building around 2.30pm. He died on the spot. Around 8pm, a large number of students had gathered at the administrative block. According to sources, the protesting students alleged that victim Anand took extreme step due to the strict professor, who did not allow him to appear for an examination as he was short on attendance. A case of unnatural death was registered at the Surathkal police station in this regard. Sources from the police department who conducted the inquiry have pointed out that it’s a case of suicide, and said the professor had no role in this. A police officer, who was investigating the case, on condition of anonymity, said that victim belonged to Maharashtra and was under medication for depression. His parents work in high-profile positions in his hometown, and he is survived by a brother, who is an IT engineer. “As there was suspicions about his death, we waited for the arrival of the victim’s parents. After they landed in Surathkal, we took them to the spot and asked them if they suspected anything foul. The parents too thought that it was a suicide, and they have not accused anyone for his death, and refused to file any complaint,” a source said. The source added that the department had put up the attendance status of every student on the notice board on Saturday. The victim had only 73 per cent attendance and was denied permission to write the exam due to shortage in attendance. He was supposed to answer an examination on Monday. The body of Anand Pathak was handed over to the family after a postmortem on Sunday afternoon.

This is one of the numerous instances where a youngster took such extreme step, despite having the possibility of a bright future. “According to studies, 90% of the suicide cases are related to depression. In majority of the suicide cases, the victims are aged between 19 and 29 years. Depression is a silent killer. We need to talk about depression and other mental illness more often, so that the stigma attached with the ailment can be driven away. Those suffering from the illness can seek professional help before it is too late,” said Pradeep Saha, director Institute of Psychiatry (IOP) at IPGMER, SSKM Hospital. While one in 7 men suffers from depression, the concurrent figure for women is one in 5. Mental health experts said that in addition to depression, 10% of the people battling with schizophrenia have the tendency to commit suicide. According to 2018 National Crime Record Bureau data, West Bengal is among the five states with high number of suicides, the figure crossing 10,000 in West Bengal where 13,255 cases of suicide were recorded in 2018. In an attempt to create awareness on mental health conditions and the treatment available, IOP in association with Kolkata Psychiatric Association is organising a four-day Kolkata Mental Health Fair in the hospital campus at IPGMER from Thursday. “Though alarming, awareness and understanding of mental health is very poor and this leads to such ailment being not diagnosed or not reported. Mental health disorders are like any other ailments that can be treated,” added Saha who is also the organising secretary of the event. Apart from doctors from the country, faculties from aboard, which include Mohan Isaac from the University of Western Australia and JS Bamrah from University of Manchester, will deliberate on different issues of mental health. A theme song on the need to talk about mental health will be played in the background. Hundreds of people are likely to visit the 30 stalls that will be put up in the hospital. These stalls will render different services, including doctors attending patients, NGO workers helping people with substance addiction and legal aid services.

The judge noted in his order that ""nothing was revealed from the case diary and the post-mortem report that it was a clear-cut murder"". No substantial evidence was collected in the last two days, nor was the suicide note recovered, for which purpose custody had been sought earlier, the judge said. The grounds on which the prosecution sought further police remand were not ""sufficient"", the court said, sending the three accused in judicial custody till June 10. After Tadvi ended her life, her family alleged that the accused, who were her seniors, tormented her and hurled casteist abuse at her. Tadvi belonged to a scheduled tribe. The accused were booked under The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, anti-ragging act as well as for abetment of suicide under IPC section 306. Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Friday set up a ""fact-finding mission committee"" to ""evaluate the background situation and the critical factors that led to the unfortunate suicide of Tadvi"", it said in a statement. Its fact-finding team will submit a report to the IMA National President within a week, it said, adding that ""IMA does not condone any discriminatory behavior"".

The incident, which was initially seemed like an accidental death on Friday morning was later confirmed as a case of suicide in the evening following investigation conducted by the Sangareddy rural police. The 21-year-old was final year Mechanical and Aeronautical engineering student. According to the police, around 12.50 am, he went to the terrace of D block. “Initially, the security officials of the IIT-Hyderabad complained stating that it was an accidental fall. However, on Friday evening, friends of the deceased informed us that they received an email which indicated that it could be a case of suicide,” said Srikanth, sub-inspector at Sangareddy (rural). Following information from the student’s friends, the police checked visuals from the closed circuit television cameras (CCTV). “After watching the CCTV footage, we concluded that it was not an accidental fall but a suicide as there was no person who entered or exited the hostel terrace before or after him. Therefore, we ruled out foul play,” said Srikanth. The student was a resident of Tirumalgherry in Secunderabad. According to police, the student had also consulted a psychologist a week back and was under medication. “While in the email sent to his friends he stated that he was not depressed, the email by him indicated that he was. He had also consulted some psychologist in the past,” said Srikanth. The student’s body was handed over the family members on Friday evening after conducting post-mortem at the Sangareddy government hospital.

In many subjects, the ‘Do You Know’ and other boxes have been marked for self-study.

In other cases, they have said, ‘This topic is time-consuming and the difficulty level is a bit high” and given it for self-learning.

The SIT also met the panel of doctors that conducted the autopsy. SIT members also collected the notebooks, diaries and exercise books of the girl along with her clothes and recorded the statements of 25 students with whom she used to stay in the school. “The names of a male science teacher and a classmate of the victim surfaced during close scrutiny of the notebooks and exercise books recovered from her room. The teacher and student were questioned separately for several hours,” said a source privy to probe. The SIT questioned them about the sequence of events on the fateful day and their activities and presence. “We found some contradictions in answers,” said an officer, but refused to divulge whether the male teacher or minor student was on radar. The SIT had moved a local court on Tuesday seeking permission to hold the lie-detector and polygraph tests of the teacher and student. On Wednesday, the SIT also obtained court permission for lie-detector and polygraph tests of two adults employed in the school and three minors. Soon after getting permission from court, the SIT started the questioning session. The questioning started around 2pm and was in progress at the time of writing of this report. IG (SIT) was himself questioning the five along with the team. The case will be worked purely on the basis of scientific evidence and then corroborated with facts, the SIT said.

There are vested interests at work to derail the ongoing police probe into the incident, he said. Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Karnik said while death of any student is sad, need of the hour is to facilitate the investigating agency carry out a free and fair probe. The school management, headed by Dr M Mohan Alva, has already expressed its willingness to cooperate with Mangaluru City Police that is carrying out the probe, he said, adding selectively targeting the institution with a history of more than three-decade smacks of smear campaign of the worst kind. Such concerted misinformation campaign against a particular institution will also hurt the standing of Dakshina Kannada regarded as education hub of the state and sow seeds of doubts in minds of parents who intend to admit their children to institutions in the district, he said. It is imperative for detractors of Alva’s Education Institutions to keep faith in the system and pave the way for free fair probe, he said and demanded that government suitably compensate Kavya’s family. To reported observations made by V S Ugrappa, chairperson of the expert committee on preventing sexual violence against women and children about shortcomings in Alva’s Educational Institutions during his visit there on Tuesday, Karnik taking potshots at his legislative council colleague said, “Ugrappa is the sole constitutional authority in the state.

Consultant clinical psychologist at National Institute of Mental Health And Neuro Sciences (Nimhans) Sunny Joseph on Friday cited Siddhartha’s recent demise during his address at Christ College in the city. A behavioural neuropsychologist, Joseph, participating in the national workshop on ‘Suicide Prevention: Role of Mental Health Professionals’ organised at the college, pointed out India slotted in at the 21st position in terms of the number of suicides reported each year. “Suicide is the third largest cause of death across the globe. The past five years have witnessed a huge spike in the number of suicide cases across the world, and in India. While seven individuals per 100,000 people committed suicide in the rest of the world, the number stands at 14 people for one lakh people in India,” said Joseph, citing that majority of the suicide cases were attributed to depression. “Most of those who take the extreme step of ending their life fall in the 15 to 35 age group,” said Joseph. In an age marked by contracting boundaries where peer pressure has taken on a malicious dimension, Joseph highlighted the need to raise awareness among the public, and called on them to detect signs of depression at an early stage and emphasised the need to seek psychological intervention at the earliest. “This workshop is an attempt at underscoring the importance of mental health,” he added. Psychology students from various colleges are participating in the workshop, and will be encouraged to interact with their peers. In a bid to make the seminar more interesting, a conducive atmosphere wherein the students will feel no hesitation in sharing their experiences has been created.

The Haryana-based family of the Class X student, who was enrolled in the school a year ago, alleged that their daughter was found hanging from the ceiling fan of a classroom by a group of girls on July 3. When the parents searched her bag, they found chits of paper with notes scribbled on them. One of the notes mentioned how she had been “wronged” and how she “hated my life” as she had “no friend”. ‘School made us sign on paper that our daughter died of natural causes’She also spoke of trauma because of “wrong treatment by everyone”. One of the pages, titled “bad day of my life”, had a few heart-shaped figures drawn on it along with tears dropping from an eye. She also wrote “I want to meet someone”. The girl’s 13-year-old sister studies in the same school while their younger brother is in another branch. The family alleged the school authorities had locked the sister in a room so that she did not reveal the alleged suicide to anyone. Soon after the lockdown was announced, the family had brought all three children home in Haryana. However, the students had to be sent back as the school authorities asked everyone to come and write their annual tests from the classroom. “On June 17, we prepared medical reports for all three and dropped them to their respective schools the next day,” the girl’s mother, a homemaker, said. On July 3, the family alleged, the chancellor called them around 5.30am and asked them to reach the girls’ school as soon as possible. “We kept asking what was wrong, but they did not tell us anything. We told them we didn’t have enough money to come to Noida but they said they would help us with the expenses to hire a vehicle,” the mother said. Their father is a daily wager, whose income had been hit hard during the lockdown. The mother said when they reached the school, their phone was taken away and some men led them to the classroom where their daughter’s body was hanging from the ceiling with two dupattas wrapped around her neck. “She was still wearing her uniform. Her salwar was loose. When we asked them what had happened, we were told she had written a suicide note against me and if the note reached police, we could land in trouble. I asked them to show me the note and hand over the body, but they refused,” she said. The girl’s parents were allegedly forced to sign on a piece of paper where it was written that she was unwell for long and had died of natural causes. “My husband was forcibly made to put his signature on the paper. My thumb impression was taken. We pleaded with them to let us take the body home, but they insisted she should be cremated in Noida. The body was cremated in Bhangel and nobody informed police,” the mother added. The parents were sent home in a car arranged by the school. The mother claimed another vehicle trailed their car till Dhaula Kuan. After returning home, the parents searched her bag and found the notes. A note mentioned Manish Tanwar and Manish Sharma multiple times. The family has approached Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for the government’s intervention. They have also written to Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath, the Noida police chief and other officials. The family is scared to visit Noida and lodge a complaint at their local police station. “They (the school) might cause us harm,” the mother said. The girl’s parents have sold the single plot they owned to arrange for money to fight the case. DCP (Noida) Sankalp Sharma said police had not received any complaint so far. “An FIR will be lodged under IPC Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) once a complaint reaches us.

688,AGRA,['16-year-old'],Allahabad HC raps SIT over probe in rape-murder case of schoolgirl,"AGRA: The Allahabad high court (HC) has expressed displeasure with the speed of investigation in the case of the death of a 16-year-old student in Uttar Pradesh's Mainpuri back in 2019. The girl was allegedly raped and found hanging inside a prominent government residential school building. The court aired its dissatisfaction after the state government submitted the status report of the case earlier this week which suggested that DNA samples of 170 suspects have been taken and sent to a laboratory for testing. The results are yet to be received. The court ordered the director general of police (DGP) to appear in person in case the DNA test reports are not in by October 25, which is the next date of hearing. On September 17, the government had announced a fresh special investigation team (SIT) to take over the case after the court pulled up the UP police for being careless with the probe. The DGP had admitted to serious lapses in investigation. He had informed the court that semen was detected on the victim’s underwear during lab tests, but the investigation officer did not send it for DNA testing within 45 days, as mandated. This would have helped match the sample with that of the accused named in the FIR as well as of other suspects. Earlier, TOI had reported that the new SIT investigating the case had collected blood samples of the suspects, including that of the son of a UP cabinet minister. A reward of Rs 1 lakh was also announced for those who came up with leads in the case by ADG of Kanpur zone, Bhanu Bhaskar, who is heading the new SIT. The case was initially believed to that of suicide. However, an FIR was subsequently registered against the school principal, hostel warden, and a boy from the arts stream with charges of murder and attempt to rape, based on a complaint filed by the girl’s father. Rape charges were added after the post-mortem report found clotted blood in the vagina and a torn hymen.

However, the victim’s family members are still demanding a CBI inquiry into the matter. STF Inspector general (IG) Amitabh Yash, said that a STF of Agra will investigate the case in detail. Though there is no time frame, they will try to submit report as soon as possible. The deceased’s mother however, expressed dissatisfaction with the government’s move and said that a CBI inquiry should be conducted into the matter. “My daughter was murdered in her school and I want justice for her. Only CBI can fairly investigate the case,” she told media persons while sitting on the second day of her hunger strike at Shaheed park. Alleging that her daughter was murdered, she said that she was not informed by the school authorities about the incident even after the doctors had declared her dead. She told TOI that she got to know about the incident from her relative, who had gone to the hospital for his wife’s check up. Earlier, the victim’s father had lodged an FIR against the principal, warden of the school and a youth on charges of attempt to rape and murder a day after the incident reported. However, the girl, who hung herself inside the hostel’s prayer room on September 16, had left a suicide note in which she wrote that she was ending her life as she was “never forgiven and subjected to constant humiliation” by students of the school after she stole a packet of snacks three years ago. One of her classmates had told media persons that the girl was slapped by almost 48 students for stealing the namkeen packet. She said that this was done in order to teach her a lesson and claimed that the incident was in the knowledge of the teachers and the principal but no action was taken by them against the students.

The incident was reported at Jhunsi police station in UP’s Pragyaraj area. Her family members said she consumed poison after a policeman refused to marry her unless she gave more dowry. Her wedding was scheduled to be held on May 15. The FIR lodged by Jhunsi police states that the girl had met the policeman on social media and visited Bhopal twice to meet him.

The Madhya Pradesh high court (MPHC) had recently stayed proceedings of Bhopal police’s FIR against Katare on allegations made by the student. It was hearing two separate petitions filed by Katare in the high court seeking quashing of both FIRs against him — one filed by the journalism student, accusing him of rape and another by her mother charging him with abduction and illegal confinement. Earlier, she had sent an application to the DIG, Bhopal, while she was in judicial custody, accusing the Congress MLA of rape. Based on the application, an FIR was lodged against Katare at the Mahila Thana, charging him with rape.

692,LUCKNOW,[],Lucknow: SC directs ICERT to help SIT in La Mart student’s death probe,"LUCKNOW: The Supreme Court (SC) has directed the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (ICERT) of the Union ministry of electronics and information technology to help the special investigation team (SIT) in investigation into the alleged murder of Class 9 student, Rahul Sridhar, in 2015. Rahul (15), a student of the La Martiniere Boys College, had fallen to death from the 60-feet tall Constantia building on the school campus on April 10, 2015. The apex court issued the directives on a petition filed in 2017 by Rahul’s brother, Rohit Sridhar, who informed the police that Rahul was in touch with one ‘Larry Conners’ through the internet and investigators have not been able to trace him. He said ‘Larry Conners’ might have a role in Rahul’s death. “We are not averse to issuing a direction to the SIT to find out Larry Conners. If some information is forthcoming in that direction, the SIT would pursue that as there is no other aspect on which we can issue any other directions to the SIT,” the order said. “The SIT would endeavour to conclude this aspect as early as possible. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team under the ministry of electronics and information technology will render whatever assistance is required,” the order added. The petitioner raised several objections to the probe conducted by the SIT, which was formed on the directions of the SC in 2019. Following the objections, the court issued an order on November 2, 2020 regarding the constitution of another SIT to conduct a fresh probe into the case. The counsel for the victim in the case, Alok Singh, told TOI that Rahul was being misguided by a person, ‘Larry Conners’, as it appears from virtual chats on Facebook. “He was not acting on his own volitions but was under influence,” he said, adding that the Lucknow police got details from Facebook, including email IDs and IP addresses, but did not act on the details and the investigation met a dead end. A week after his death in 2015, his parents filed a murder case against unidentified persons. However, in its final report submitted to the trial court, police termed Rahul’s death a suicide. In February 2016, the family challenged the report in the court of the chief judicial magistrate who ordered a reinvestigation. Next year, the family moved the high court and sought a CBI probe but the High Court directed the police to conclude investigations within a month. It dismissed the demand for a probe by an independent agency. The family was forced to knock on the doors of the Supreme Court which first took up the issue on the basis of a special leave petition (SLP) filed by Rohit Sridhar in 2017.

With this, the number of students, who committed suicide since the past few days, has gone up to 19. This is among the highest number of suicides recorded post Inter results, in the state, over the last four years. Read AlsoWhat happened to recommendations on suicide prevention?HYDERABAD: Even two decades after the Neerada Reddy Committee report suggested measures to prevent student suicides in erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, nothing has been done yet to implement those. Following a rise in the number of Inter student suicides, the erstwhile AP government, in 2001, hadRights activists alleged that due to negligence of the officials who released the Intermediate results in a hurried manner and without proper checks, students were either committing suicide or slipping into depression. In 2018, six student suicides were reported after the results were announced. While there were no such suicides in 2015 and 2016, one Intermediate first-year student killed himself by jumping in front of a train in 2017. Also, unlike other years, when most of these cases were recorded within the first two to three days of the results being announced, this year, there have been suicides through the week. Intermediate results in Telangana were announced on April 18. On Tuesday late afternoon, a 17-year-old girl, S Jyothi, set herself ablaze at her home at Tirumalpur under Shadbad police limits while her parents were away. A student of commerce-economics-civics (CEC) at the Vivekananda Junior College, Jyothi failed in second year civics paper. “While neighbours, on hearing her screams, rushed to her rescue and tried to douse the fire, she had already suffered 80 per cent burns by then. She died by the time they could shift her to the hospital,” said M Ravi Kumar, sub inspector, Shadbad police station. Though Jyothi, daughter of an agriculturist, did not leave any suicide note, cops suspect she committed suicide because of failing in her exam. In another case reported from Bommalaramaram police station limits, a 19-year-old second-year Intermediate student, Mithi, who had failed in physics and zoology, hanged herself at her house late on Tuesday night. “She took the extreme step after her parents went to sleep. They noticed it only on Wednesday morning,” said K Venkatesh, sub inspector, Bommalaramaram police station. In the third case of suicide, an 18-year-old boy, C Raju, who failed in economics and civics papers, was found hanging from a tree on a school premises in Madur village under Shankarampet police station in Medak district. Cops said Raju’s family members found him missing from home when they woke up on Wednesday morning. During a search, along with locals, they found him hanging from a tree inside the school, located 200 metres from his residence. Alarmed at the spate of suicides, especially this year, teachers said there was an immediate need to reduce the pressure that is being mounted on students from various quarters. “Majority student suicides reported in the last many years is due to immense pressure put on them by college managements, especially corporate colleges, and parents. The race to secure better ranks and marks burdens the average student who is forced to match up to the standards of high-performing students,” said Madhusudan Reddy, president of the Telangana Government Junior Lecturers Association, adding how even the grading system has failed to take the pressure off students as thought.

698,RAIPUR,"['17-year-old', '30-year-old']","In Bilaspur, boy’s suicide, a code in blood & ‘betrayal’ by woman teacher","RAIPUR: Feeling betrayed, humiliated and harassed, a 17-year-old school boy in Chhattisgarh took his own life, alleging sexual and mental abuse by a female teacher. He left behind a ‘coded’ suicide note on his laptop and a passkey — written in his blood on a wall — to decode it. The Class XI boy had a brilliant academic record, had won a science Olympiad last month, and was seen by peers and teachers as a tech wiz. He was found hanging at home in Bilaspur on March 18, minutes after the teacher visited him. Police have found chats on the boy’s mobile phone that indicate suffering and harassment at the hands of the teacher, and alleged provocation by her. Police used the passkey to decode the suicide note. Part of it says: “According to Indian society, men are always wrong. A woman can never be wrong. There is nothing like gender neutral rape laws. There is nothing like child harassment.” It’s possible he wasn’t aware of the Pocso Act, which is gender neutral. On the basis of the investigation so far, the accused, a 30-year-old, has been arrested on charges of provocation for suicide and sections 12, 13 of Pocso Act, investigation officer Parivesh Tiwari of Torwa police station told TOI. Police have seized a video of the suicide. The teacher is a ‘Shikshakarmi’ with a government school and used to teach chemistry at a private school that the boy was studying in last year. When TOI contacted the boy’s family, only his aunt could bring herself to talk about it. “We are devastated. I will never forget the sight of the boy hanging and the numbers written on the wall. It was terrifying. His suicide was recorded on his phone, which is now with police,” she said. “My nephew was a cyber and IT expert. He wasn’t eating properly for the past three months and looked troubled. He had got into a cocoon and would ask his mother not to disturb him as he was busy in studies. His laptop, which is with police, has details of his tragic story,” she said, adding that everyone in the family believed he was destined for great things. “Who knew it would end like this,” she said. On March 18, when the boy’s mother was leaving home for some work, one of his friends arrived with a woman, who had her face covered. He identified her as his sister and the mother had no reason to think otherwise. Police say she was the chemistry teacher, who once had a relationship with the victim. The duo went inside and met the boy. When his mother returned home, she found the door to his room shut from inside. She knocked repeatedly and called out to him but there was no answer. Her heart pounding with fear, she somehow forced the door open only to find her boy hanging from the ceiling. Preliminary investigation indicates that the teacher and the boy were in a relationship that turned into sexual and mental harassment. He was deeply disturbed after he learnt that she was having an affair with someone, said police. Tiwari said that the teacher was scheduled to marry a colleague soon. The chats indicate that the boy, despite feeling betrayed, was pleading with her and seeking love and importance from the woman but she responded coldly, say police. The boy has sought justice in the suicide note, alleging mental and sexual harassment.In her statement to police, however, the teacher has accused the boy of stalking her. She didn’t file a police complaint, nor did she share this with her friends and fiancé, say police. Asked why she visited the boy on the day of his suicide, she told police that she wanted to get her ‘hacked phone’ repaired as he was an expert in handling mobile phones. Police are taking the statements of the boy’s school friends and other teachers. It's not yet clear what happened after the teacher met the boy at his home on March 18. The friend who had taken her there is also being questioned. The victim’s mother has no idea where he got the new nylon rope he was found hanging with, as she had never seen it at home. “It’s a very grim case. It’s an example of how delicate the relationship between a teacher and student is, and there is a strong message here for everyone. We must pay attention to any sign of distress among teenagers and students. It’s the collective responsibility of teachers, parents and friends,” Parivesh Tiwari said. Social activist Priyanka Shukla, a Bilaspur high court advocate, believes the case needs to be investigated on several angles as there are many ‘open ended sides’ to it. “A special team of police should be constituted, headed by a senior officer, so that no stone remains unturned,” she said.

While schools try to blame the death of the child on other reasons, in most of the cases humiliation faced in front of their peers, drives a child to the edge. “Humiliation at any point in school will deeply affect a child, to avoid any untoward incidents there should be proper communication between parents, teachers, and students,” said Aravinda Jata, a parent adding that schools should introspect as to why such incidents happen only in mediocre schools. Teachers, on the other hand, say that such suicides happen because parents are too possessive about their kids who have no practical exposure and fumble at the first sight of a problem. “A child will have a suicidal tendency if he/she is mentally weak. Parent’s possessiveness is making kids very sensitive. If a child thinks he needs to end his life, if the day is not going according to his wish, then it is a collective failure of teachers, parents, and society,” said A Lakshmi Darithri, principal, Surya-the Global School. Suicidal tendencies, according to doctors, are gradually developed behavioural problem. Dr Minhaz Zafar, a consultant psychiatrist at Apollo Hospitals, says at least 20 percent of the population is depressed at any given time but not even one percent approaches a doctor. “These days children have poor resilience. If we see the recent case where a girl committed suicide after school asked her parents to come and collect her cellphone which she brought to school, it clearly shows that she was worried about potential outcome,” said Dr Praveen Kumar C, a psychiatrist whose area of expertise include child psychology. “To overcome such problems, teachers should be trained to notice early warning signs of suicidal tendency and warn parents. Schools should have an in-house counselor, who should talk with students regularly and do not hesitate to talk about suicides and depression,” he added saying that children have poor frustration and ambiguity tolerance.

For three years, he had been fighting for redemption after failing to clear his Class X exams for no fault of his. The cheque for Rs 1 lakh that he held in his hands validated his claim that the laxity of his teachers and education department officials had led to his failure. “I couldn’t appear for three subjects in my Class X exams because of typhoid. But I sat for the re-examination and was surprised to find when the CBSE results were announced that I had failed in three subjects: English, science and Sanskrit,” Choudhary told TOI. “I did not believe I had failed, so I filed complaints. Later, I approached even the cops. However, when nothing happened, I wrote to DCPCR about my suicidal feelings.” In its report on October 20, 2018, TOI had reported how Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) had found the education officials and teachers guilty of not having uploaded Choudhary’s internal marks and ordered the compensation. But the principal and two teachers of Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School in northwest Delhi had contested the panel’s findings in Delhi High Court. The lapses came to light when Choudhary went to get his school-leaving certificate to pursue a correspondence course. The new principal enquired about his marks from CBSE, which informed him that the student’s internal marks had never been submitted by the school. School management committee member Vikas Saini counselled the young boy and helped him file complaints.

He had scored 80% in his Class XII board exams. A good student, Choudhary lost eight months and was only admitted to Class XI in November 2017.

It was only when the new principal came and realised he was a good student that he enquired from CBSE and the truth emerged.

Moreover, DCPCR also ordered an FIR against us, so we wanted a court stay on it.” Choudhary, relieved that his trauma has finally ended, wants to spend the compensation money on his education. “I will use this money to take coaching classes for the Staff Selection Commission exams and hope to qualify for a government job,” said the unassuming boy. “I come from a poor family.

The boy, a student of Class XII, jumped from the balcony of his 11th-floor flat, less than two hours after the post went up. He was trolled viciously, and also allegedly threatened over the phone. His parents were asleep in their room when he walked to the balcony and jumped. The post, written on May 4, detailed an encounter two years ago, when the boy and the girl who wrote the post were both in Class X. The girl alleged he had insisted on meeting her a few days after they began talking in school. And when they met outside her housing society, he had allegedly proposed walking to the basement and, once there, asked her to perform a sexual act on him. After the boy committed suicide, the trolls turned on the girl. She had later told TOI she stood by her post. The boy’s father had subsequently filed a police complaint. A case was registered against unknown persons on May 14 under sections of abetment to suicide and a special investigation team was formed to probe the case. He has now alleged that the post was not a spontaneous one but a planned move by a group of four-five girls. He has also alleged that a man is involved too as his son had received threats over the phone from him. “The post caused acute mental harassment and maligned my son’s image. I was also told by his friends that he also received threat calls from a man. I got the man’s phone number from my son’s call records, but it has been switched off since May 5,” the boy’s father said. Other than the man who allegedly called his son, all the others in the list he gave police are minors.

738,NEW DELHI,[],One or more persons may have helped others in tying themselves,"NEW DELHI: The FIR lodged in the mass death of the Bhatia family in Burari indicates that one or more persons assisted the others in tying and blindfolding themselves. One of them was likely Lalit Bhatia’s wife, Tina, because the FIR notes she alone among the 11 dead did not have her hands tied though her mouth was gagged with a piece of cloth. Investigating officers surmise that Lalit and Tina together prepared the others for death, after which the wife secured her husband’s hands before hanging herself. The FIR says that Lalit’s hands, like those of the others, were tied and his face covered with cloth. Their son, Shivam, similarly was blindfolded and had his limbs bound. The body of Lalit’s brother, Bhavnesh, was found blindfolded and with the legs tied as was that of his wife, Savita. The bodies of their daughters, Monu and Neetu, were found hanging next to each, the former with her legs tied, the latter both blindfolded and her upper and lower limbs secured. Bhavnesh’s son, Dhruv, in addition to his limbs being bound, had his faced covered by a cloth. A team led by DCP Joy Tirkey visited the house on Tuesday and analysed the crime scene. The investigators recovered documents and notes which suggested the extreme step had to be taken on a full-moon night before Bhadra, or July 1. The cops said that some person seemed to have climbed to the terrace and tied the chunnis used for the hangings to the iron net in a pattern of three. “The method of tying the chunni knots was mentioned in the notes recovered from the house,” said a cop. The family had also used five stools for the process, indicating that two people stood on a stool each. Pratibha used to give students tuitions in the morning and evening. A domestic help of the family had said that the children would sit in the hallway on stools. Lalit’s wife Tina had bought at least eight new stools four days before their deaths. The cops think that the younger members probably did not know of the rituals planned that night, but had trusted the person conducting them. ",04-07-2018,"['death', 'dead', 'death', 'crime']"

741,NEW DELHI,['75-year-old'],"Counselling sessions for farmers at Singhu Border to prevent burnout, suicide bids","NEW DELHI: Despite their rock-hard determination to sustain the over 40-day-old agitation against the new farm laws, many protesting farmers at Delhi borders are falling prey to anxiety and depression, with a few having allegedly claimed their lives fighting this prolonged battle in biting cold. Braving the elements and the odds stacked up against them, an overwhelming number of farmers have been protesting at Singhu Border and two other sites since November 26, but their ""sedentary lifestyle"" at present and ""psychological sedimentation"" is taking a toll on their physical and mental well-being. According to NGOs running medical camps at the Singhu Border, the nerve centre of the massive agitation, these farmers are brave in their spirit, but some have become vulnerable, facing extreme weather and may be a ""sense of waning hope"" that have translated into suicides at times. However, to ease their psychological burden, US-based NGO, United Sikhs, has started carrying out counselling sessions for farmers at their camp set up on the Haryana side of the protest site at Singhu Border. ""So many farmers have died during this agitation, some of them claimed their own lives. While they may have a strong determination, but the extreme cold and pent-up emotions, coupled with sedentary lifestyle at present as they are not going to fields, is making them psychologically vulnerable,"" said Sanya Kataria, a clinical psychologist and a volunteer at the camp. A student of Doctorate in Psychology at a private university in Noida, she has been offering services via the United Sikhs camp in the last few days. ""These farmers have been sitting for over 40 days on a national highway as part of this agitation. While most can withstand the physical rigour and biting cold as they are used to working hard, some of them have fallen prey to anxiety, depression and also hopelessness coupled with lack of self-esteem and feeling of frustration. It is a dangerous combination,"" she told PTI. So, problems like attention deficiency, restlessness, headaches are common symptoms being seen in those who have chosen to visit the camp for counselling, Kataria said. In some cases, there is an emotional burnout from extreme stress and that is what ""we attempt to detect early"" through sessions, so that they won't attempt or even contemplate taking any extreme step, she said. Asked what kind of activities are done during a counselling session, the medical volunteer said the idea basically is to make them stop thinking about one ""negative thought continuously"". ""So, we engage them in activities to distract their minds, and create greater mindful awareness, or what we call 'grounding'. So, we ask them to name five things they can see around, four things they can touch, three things they can hear, two things they can smell and one thing they can taste,"" Kataria said. Besides, the techniques of diaphragmatic breathing or drawing breath from the nose and exhaling from nose itself, also proves useful, she said. Gurdeep Kaur, assistant coordinator, at the United Sikhs India office in Delhi, says the news of many farmers committing suicide at Singhu Border have ""caused great distress to us"". ""We don't want any farmer to die, and prevent any further suicide bids. So, our counselling calms their minds. We also ask farmers to come for follow-up sessions,"" she said. Besides, there is a facility for physiotherapy at the camp, and and general physicians and other doctors come too, ""some as volunteers, other on a payment basis, by rotation"", Kaur added. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) national spokesman Rakesh Tikait had recently claimed that 47 farmers have sacrificed their lives during the protests. A 75-year-old farmer protesting against the Centre's new farm laws had allegedly hanged himself at the Uttar Pradesh-Delhi border in Ghazipur, earlier this month. Medical Services Centre (MSC), a volunteer organisation, based in Kolkata, has also been running a camp since the start of the protest late November. Dr Nikhita Murali, a physician, who has been offering services for the past few days at the Singhu Border, said, ""Many women who have joined the protest are having health issues too."" ""Sitting continuously or cooking for a long time in kitchen is causing joint aches but many farmers are coming to us with problems of improper blood sugar level or blood pressure. Headache and bodyaches also common ailments among them,"" she said. Asked what kind of problems women protesters are facing, Murali, a native of Kochi, said some are exhibiting gynaecological infections like in the reproductive tract. ""These women belong to conservative families, so they don't talk about their medical problems, and feel uncomfortable talking to a male doctor about any gynaecological issues. After talking to me during consultation, they revealed that they have such problems,"" the doctor said. But, none of them want to go back from the protest site, they wish to soldier on. Their will power is very strong, she added. On Saturday, it was yet another day of protest for the farmers in the ritual January winter, even as the eight round of talks between the farmer leaders and the Centre remained inconclusive on Friday. Cries of 'Saada Haq, Aithe Rakh', 'Jo Bole So Nihal' and 'Kisan Union Ekta Zindabad' rent the air throughout the day.

Based on the complaint, Cyberabad police registered a case against students on Tuesday. On Monday, University of Hyderabad Registrar, P Sardar Singh, lodged a complaint against a group of students alleging that they have damaged the varsity property by carrying out digging at the North Shopping Complex without permission.

We have to first see if the removed constructions at the shopping complex were built with varsity permission or not.

A bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit said it was necessary for Chauhan to file affidavit for the court to know his stand as the student, Sushant Rohilla, had written a mail to him before committing suicide. The apex court had in September last year taken suo motu cognisance of a letter written by Rohilla‘s friend Raghav Sharma to the Chief Justice of India, blaming the Amity authorities for the suicide on August 10, 2016. The court had also appointed senior advocate F S Nariman as amicus curiae to assist it in the case. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for Amity, told the bench that its law school had nothing to do with the University and there was no need to direct Chauhan to file affidavit. He said the law school was affiliated to Indraprastha University and followed rules and regulations of Bar Council of India. But his plea was opposed by Nariman who contended that Chauhan should be asked to explain what he had done after receiving the student’s mail.

He later told her that he was going to “shoot himself in the head”. Joshi said prima facie it appears to be a case of unrequited love. But police are also scanning other platforms and questioning the boy’s family as well as his friends to ascertain if he was suffering from depression or was subject to online harassment and trolling. Days before the alleged suicide, the youth had shared a post against online trolling on Facebook on World Suicide Prevention Day on September 10.

Under pressure to perform well in coaching classes, IIT aspirant Komal Sharma (name changed) attempted suicide.  After undergoing counselling, Sherya, now 18, is leading a normal life and doing good in her studies. Komal, now 17, too has recovered and opted to study by herself and prepare for the competitive world. Though both teenagers were saved from student burnouts, other may not be so lucky.  Though there are no statistics from a single source, psychiatrists in the city are seeing an increase in the number of school and college students with mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, aggressiveness, and behavioural problems, and show disorders like disobedience, conflict with parents and tantrums.  Senior psychiatrist Dr Sudhir Bhave says he sees five to seven children who need some form of urgent intervention every day. This is a result of multiple pressures that children face not only at school, but also at home as parents try to live their unfulfilled dreams through them. “We try to be the window to the world for the children. We also counsel parents to stop being demanding and interfering. We also use what is called as therapeutic relationship, where we use different relationships to treat the child,” he adds. Psychologist Shruti Kala concurs, “Parents want their child to play the piano, excel in basketball, be a school topper and aim for working in NASA. This is simply absurd. Why can’t they let the child be and follow their passion.”  Even educated parents indulge in such behaviour. Senior psychiatrist Dr Vivek Kirpekar says, “Parents try to push their child to join an IIT from class VIII itself. The mounting pressure to make their parents happy may impair a child’s performance in studies and they may develop confused personalities.”  Schools too have been accused of pushing their students to excel to improve the results of their institute.

In the first case, the deceased was identified as Kadiyala Paneesh (16), a first year MPC student at Narayana Saraswati Campus in Nidamanuru. According to Patamata circle inspector Umamaheswara Rao, Paneesh was found hanging at around 5 am in his college hostel room by his friends. The Narayana staff informed the police about the incident, who reached the spot and shifted the body to Vijayawada Government General Hospital. “He was last seen at around 10 pm by his friends,” Umamaheswara said. The police said they are yet to ascertain the reason behind the extreme step. They said no suicide note was found. However, Paneesh’s family members alleged that the college management was harassing him and there was academic pressure on him. He had even mentioned that hostel wardens were complaining against him to the principal and forcing him to shift his room. Paneesh’s maternal uncle, Koteswara Rao told reporters outside Narayana campus: “Nobody knew where Paneesh was between 10 pm and 5 am, and the next thing we know that was our boy is shifted to the mortuary. We believe the college is responsible for his extreme step, and they negligently say that they don’t know about it.” In the second case, Mandadi Sai Krishna (22), a BTech third year student from NRI Engineering College, ended his life by jumping in front of a train near Devinagar area in Vijayawada late last night. According to Government Railway Police inspector, Ratna Raju, locals alerted them about the incident in the morning.

748,CHENNAI,[],Tamil Nadu: No support system for families losing loved ones to suicide,"CHENNAI: Surviving a loved one's suicide is in itself a difficult task. And when the society attaches a stigma to the family, life becomes miserable. In most cases, the blame falls on the parents who spend the rest of their lives grieving and suffering from survivors' guilt. Experts said such parents are very vulnerable themselves. Unlike in the US or Australia, India does not have support groups to help such families. ""There is no greater pain than losing your loved ones, especially a child, to suicide,"" said Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, consultant psychiatrist and founder of Sneha, a suicide prevention helpline. She said the stigma weighs down on them to such an extent that the families get cut off from society and feel they could have prevented it. She recalled a case where, three years after the death of her child, the mother too ended her life. ""What they need is more support, empathy and kindness from people. Lack of this only adds to their stress,"" she said. A recent study in the Harvard Health Publishing said each person who dies by suicide leaves behind an estimated six or more ""suicide survivors"". The grieving can be very complex and traumatic. And it is they who need more support than the others, but get less. ""Because families are often reluctant to come out, confide and speak. They fear the stigma. It is difficult,"" said Dr Lakshmi. Dr Vandana Gopikumar, co-founder, The Banyan, said support groups can consist of a more intimate circle with closer connections so they are more comfortable talking. She said the conversations in these support groups must be more insightful, meaningful, and non-judgemental. This will help address the survivor's guilt. ""It needs to go beyond death by suicide to larger social and philosophical constructs around loneliness, exclusion, and what lack of kindness does to a person."" The recent NCRB data revealed that Tamil Nadu has recorded more than 13,000 suicides in 2019, the second-highest in the country. In the past one week, four students committed suicide in the state. ""The need now is to create a more humane and kinder society. We must all reach out to each other and approach with empathy. It's high time we do that,"" said Vandana.

750,Yavatmal,[],Adivasi students deprived of drinking water,"Yavatmal: Village Mangrul Chavhal of Nandgaon Khandeshwar (Amravati district) is deprived of potable drinking water, thanks to the contractor of Nagpur-Mumbai Samruthi Maha Marg (High Way) currently under construction. There is a big well on a two-acre land which belongs to the Adivasi Fase Pardhi Sudhar Samiti which is running a school for the community since 2011. The water from the well was used for catering to the daily needs of the students and employees of the school. However, on the night of January 4, labourers of the construction company reached the spot with JCB and tried to dump murrum into the well to seal it. Alert employees of the school rushed to the well and protested against the action. “We shall jump into the well and commit suicide and then, you may fill up the well,” they told the construction workers around midnight. When workers of the contractor found that the school employees were unrelenting, they slowly withdrew from the site. Around 60-70 litres of diesel thrown into the well contaminated the water. On January 5, a delegation of women from the village under the leadership of Ratisha Matin Bhosale met the tehsildar and submitted a memorandum to be forwarded to the district collector of Amravati to ensure justice to the aggrieved. Students have been rendered waterless since January 4. Leading light of the Fase Pardhi community, Matin Bhosale, said that though they are Indian citizens by birth, they are deprived of any facility made available by the Centre as well as the state. “We have no identity cards, we have no education, we are denied constitutional protection and are often implicated in false criminal cases,” said Bhosale, adding, he has played an important role to ensure education to the Fase Pardhi community students and Prashnachinna Adivasi Fase Pardhi Ashram Shala. “During PM Narendra Modi’s visit to Pandharkawda before the general elections, we had undertaken a 40-km rally on foot to the venue which was well attended by the community members from all over Vidarbha. We were stopped by bureaucrats 5km away from the PM’s public address. They promised to provide us constitutional protection but nothing is being done,” lamented Bhosale. Meanwhile, women from the Fase Pardhi community were rounded up by forest officials in Pusad on January 6. Birds (thither) trapped by them to earn their livelihood were seized. Women were confined in the forest office till the evening. “Though 16 birds were seized, the panchnama was made for only 12,” complained Maya Pawar who later led a protest to the SDO office and submitted a memorandum addressed to the governor of Maharashtra urging him to intervene in the planned atrocities meted out to them. Permit us to either opt for mass suicide or join the Naxalite movement, she added. “Forest wealth is the constitutional right of the adivasis. But power drunk officers are deliberately exploiting adivasis under the pretext of lame excuses,” said social activist Manish Jadhav, who warned the government for indirectly encouraging youngsters of the Fase Pardhi community to join the Naxalite movement by taking up weapons to fight against unpardonable injustice and second rate treatment.

The student was reportedly threatened and intimidated by the college’s disciplinary committee when he was summoned for questioning, a senior police officer said. “The boy (Harsha) was told that they were capable of ruining his academic career. That could have forced him to take the extreme step,” he said. Harsha had jumped from the seventh floor of the college building in Kasavanahalli near Parappana Agrahara on Monday afternoon. Police have booked ten persons, including the dean, Dhanraj Swamy, and assistant dean G S Rakesh for abetment to suicide and destruction of evidence. The others booked include hostel warden and chemistry lecturer B L Bhaskar, and disciplinary committee members — Ravi Kumar, T K Ramesh, Nipun Kumar, Amudha, B Venkatesh, S R Nagaraj and N S Murthy. According to dean Dhanaraj Swamy, the disciplinary committee had questioned Harsha on the basis of report prepared by warden Bhaskar stating that Harsha was a part of the group that had vandalised the hostel over water shortage issue. Students, however, had maintained that Harsha used to demand corrective measures and was not a vandal as claimed by the college management, police said. During the inquiry, police said, the committee members were very rude and had threatened Harsha. ‘We can make you suffer for lifetime. If we wish, you will not get a good job,’ a committee member had threatened. Police said they would question the committee members — Ravikumar and T K Ramesh. Additional commissioner of police (east) S Murugan said they are collecting evidence to strengthen the complaint filed by deceased student’s father. “It is a sensitive case and we cannot arrest anyone without proper evidence.

The student, who was suspended for a fight with another student, had committed suicide by jumping off a cliff in July. “We have gone through the allegations made in the FIR. Prima facie, in our view, an offence of abetment of suicide of a child under the Indian Penal Code is not made out,” said a division bench of Justice Ranjit More and Justice Anant Badar. “We, therefore, by way of interim relief, direct the Dehu Road police station not to take coercive action against the petitioners named in the FIR registered at the instance of (the boy’s father).” The court was hearing a petition by principal Sojan Puthenparampil John (55), physical education teacher Fattesing Deore (52), Hindi teacher Shradha Pathak (36), Maths teacher Pratibha Tomar (37) and English teacher Bindu Kumar (46), seeking the quashing of the FIR. “The principal and teachers have been falsely implicated in the case,” said advocate Aniket Nikam, counsel for the accused. “There is no element of abetment of suicide on their part. If this becomes a precedent, then it would kill the morale of teachers and no action would be taken against errant students.” According to the police, the class X student and three other boys were suspended for four days by the school authorities after the parent of another student complained that they had assaulted his son. On July 4, while returning from tuitions with friend, the student jumped off a cliff. In his suicide note, said the teachers and the principal were responsible for his death as they had suspended him and made him sit outside the staff room. The boy’s father lodged an FIR claiming that the teachers and principal had tortured his son and drove him to commit suicide and they were booked under Section 305 of the IPC relating to abetting the suicide of a child. The petitioners claimed that the FIR made vague allegations and there was no evidence against them. The offence requires that the abettor should have instigated or actively suggested or stimulated the victim to commit suicide. They urged HC to strike down the FIR and restrain the police from filing a chargesheet in the matter.

770,Bareilly,[],Cops probe disappearance of evidence in med student suicide case," Bareilly: After preliminary investigation, police here have added the charge of causing disappearance of evidence in the FIR related to the suicide of a first year medical student at an institute in Bareilly. Ananya Dixit, 18, was found hanging from the ceiling of her hostel room at a Shri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences on September 6. College authorities had broken into the room after there was no response from Ananya when her roommates repeatedly knocked at the door, which was bolted from inside. According to Ananya&rsquo;s family, college authorities did nothing to save their daughter, and the body continued to hang from the ceiling till the police arrived. College authorities have, however, claimed that they immediately checked the pulse and concluded that the girl was dead, following which police was informed. Anadi Dixit, father of the girl, came to Bareilly on September 8 and met top police officials, alleging that the case had been investigated in a shoddy manner in order to give a clean chit to the college administration. &ldquo;There is no record with the authorities which can prove that my daughter left the academic area and came back to the hostel on the institute campus. She never went to class, as something untoward had happened. If not killed, she definitely committed suicide after something went horribly wrong with her in the college premises,&rdquo; Anadi said. Meanwhile, an FIR has already been lodged based on Anadi&rsquo;s complaint, which had leveled several charges against college authorities, including ragging, medical negligence and destruction of evidence at the scene of the suicide. College authorities claimed that the family&rsquo;s allegations were misplaced. &ldquo;We understand the agony and pain of the family, but the college is more than willing to extend any help to the police or the family with the ongoing investigation. We were not informed about any deteriorating health condition of Ananya, nor did she share any problem with us pertaining to anything going wrong in the college premises,"" said Aditya Murti, director (administration) at SRMSIMS. Two mobile phones including an iPhone, and a black diary, were recovered from Ananya's room, which are also being examined. &ldquo;We are yet to unlock the iPhone which has been sent to the forensics lab. Further, contents of the personal diary do not point at anything alarming. Some of the serious allegations made by the father, however, are being investigated.

Ekisha’s family members threatened to intensify their protest if the principal of the school where she studied and the teachers accused of driving her to suicide were not arrested at the earliest. “I don’t know about the progress of the investigation. I agree my daughter was an average student. But in her class, some students were below-average. My daughter was deliberately graded poorly and made to fail in science and social science papers,” said Raghav Sah, Ekisha’s father, on Sunday. He said he would continue to seek a CBI probe. In an interaction with journalists, MLA Singh appealed to the school management to be more sensitive towards students’ welfare. “The kind of allegations the family has made are quite serious. Had the school management been more sensitive, and the parents informed about her academic performance time to time, this incident could have been averted,” Singh said. The management of Ahlcon Public School, where Ekisha studied, has denied any role in driving her to suicide. Singh also urged the police to ensure a fair and fast probe.

The parents also met police officers at Ekisha’s home and demanded verification of teachers and enhanced security measures for children in private schools. ANSPA president Yatendra Kasana told TOI that the police has sought evidence from the family about physical and sexual harassment complaint against the two teachers and the Principal of the private school in Delhi’s Mayur Vihar where the girl studied. “We met the family and it was great distress to see that police officers present including the station house officer of Sector 24 have been demanding evidence from the family to support their allegations against the teachers,” Kasana said adding that there have been no arrests in the case despite the fact that the teachers have been booked under the stringent Prevention of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act. After the meeting, scores of parents led by the association members gathered at the Noida Stadium in Sector 21 to deliberate how they will support the aggrieved family. “The family was denied a permission to hold a candle march on Saturday. We have assured them that we will join them in any kind of protest or agitation if required,” Kasana said. Sector 24 Station Officer Akhilesh Tripathi however said that the family has been asked to share details of eye-witnesses or persons close to the girl who knew that the girl was being followed or harassed by the teachers.

Ekisha’s family members said that so far they hadn’t heard from the school or the police regarding the role of the accused teachers. “Apart from invoking POCSO sections, there was no other communication. This is not something one expects when your child dies because of someone’s behaviour. We want the teachers to be arrested immediately,” said the victim’s mother.

Sentencing to seven years' rigorous imprisonment a cook, Mohammad Khan (29), for the rape, the sessions court questioned the sub-inspector Sadhana Ingale's humiliation of the victim and called her investigation sloppy. District judge P P Jadhav said: ""In this case, the parents of the victim are alive. However, the investigating officer woman PSI Smt Sadhana Ingale unnecessarily sent the victim girl to remand home. Thereby, the victim was unnecessarily humiliated. It might have resulted in taking a stringent step by her-i.e. suicide."" The convict was also slapped with Rs 25,500 in fines. ‘Sending victim to remand home an act of humiliation’Passing its judgment on Friday, the court said the “negligent and casual investigation” by Ingale was required to be brought to the notice of senior police officers for action. “It is further to be noted here that, in present case, though it was revealed that mobile phones were used, no mobile handsets were seized and no CDR (call data records) were collected,” the court said. The judge also castigated the police in general for their uninterested attitude in such sensitive cases. “… (I)n various Pocso Act cases, the investigation is carried out by woman police officers recklessly, negligently and very casually, who never attempt to find out witnesses and record their statements,” the judge said. “On the contrary, they wait for the witnesses to visit the police station … , who (witnesses) merely put their signatures on documents prepared by other police employees.” Khan was held guilty under Section 341 and Section 376 of the IPC and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act of 2012. Prosecutor Vinit Kulkarni said to the court that in December 2011, the victim visited the Khawaja Garib Nawaz restaurant to buy a chicken dish and was raped by Khan. Kulkarni said the girl was gagged and raped by Khan, who closed all doors. Khan was also accused of threatening to kill the girl, a student, by burning her in a tandoor if she disclosed what had happened to anyone. Later, in May 2013, a neighbour spoke to the victim’s mother that the victim might elope with Khan, who, the neighbour said, was of bad character. The mother spoke to her child, who said she had been raped by Khan. An offence was registered with the police, who arrested Khan. The girl was sent to a remand home and, and upon her return, committed suicide at her residence on June 17, 2013, it was said in court. The defence contested the prosecution version. The judge, after hearing both sides, came down heavily on the woman investigation officer. “… (T)hey don’t take pains to investigate the offence properly or attempt to find the truth,” the judge said. “Even in the present case, the approach of investigating officer is very casual and she has unnecessarily caused humiliation to the victim girl by sending her to remand home.” ",02-04-2019,"['rape', 'suicide', 'imprisonment', 'rape', 'humiliation', 'sloppy', 'stringent', 'suicide', 'humiliation', 'negligent', 'recklessly', 'guilty', 'raped', 'raped', 'threatening', 'kill', 'burning', 'raped', 'offence', 'suicide', 'pains', 'offence', 'humiliation']"

They said efforts are on to nab three persons accused of the crime.  According to police, the girl student, aged 15-16 years, had gone missing from her house in a village under the Harduaganj police station area on Sunday morning.  Shortly after her family received a message that she has been kidnapped and demanded Rs 5 lakh as ransom for her release, they added.  The kidnappers warned that if the money was not paid, a video showing the victim in a compromising position would be posted on social media, police said.  According to the complaint filed by the girl's family at Gandhi park police station on Monday, they were unable to raise the money and were desperately trying to search for her when they were asked by police to identify a dead body of a girl which was found several kilometres away from their village along the railway tracks.  Police said they are examining a 'suicide note' that was recovered from the site where the victim's body was found.  Superintendent of police (city) Kuldip Singh told reporters that on Monday night the family named three persons as accused in connection with the incident.  The three have been booked for murder and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, he added.  Police said a thorough investigation is underway and the perpetrators would not be spared.  The body has been sent for post-mortem, they said.

784,AGRA,[],Uttar Pradesh: Minor from Etah jailed as adult in ‘drugs case’ kills self,"AGRA: A boy from Etah, 15, who was arrested on drug possession charges, produced in court as an adult and sent to the district jail instead of a juvenile detention centre for three months killed himself at home on Tuesday. Four policemen have been booked for abetment of suicide. “On March 9 (this year), my son had stepped out to buy pizza. He was arrested,” said his father, a farmer. Police said they found 500g diazepam on him. “He was kept in lockup and beaten up for four days. Cops demanded Rs 2 lakh to release him.” The boy was eventually produced in court, as an adult, and sent to jail under the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on March 12. Had he been tried at a juvenile court, he could have got bail right then. He spent three months in jail while his parents tried to get him out. On July 25, he finally got out. “Police had not been able to file a chargesheet,” the boy’s counsel Yaduveer Singh Chauhan said. After he came home, things were different. “He had changed. He was always a cheerful teenager. He went into depression,” his father said. The Class XII commerce student had been a diligent student, scoring the first division in his Class X boards, and wanted to get an MBA. He would have turned 16 in November. “He lost interest in everything. Those three months had broken him. He killed himself in his room on Tuesday afternoon … I have no trust in Etah police officials. I hope CM Yogi Adityanath intervenes to get me justice.” The father filed a complaint against four cops — sub-inspectors Mohit Rana and Shiv Kumar, head constable Upendra Kumar and constable Ravish Kumar. “On the basis of the complaint, an FIR has been registered against the four policemen under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC. Earlier this year, an FIR was registered against the boy under the NDPS Act and he was sent to jail on court orders. The entire matter is being investigated,” Etah SSP Udai Shanker Singh said. Sub-inspector Mohit Rana was at the centre of another probe last month when it was alleged that he had arrested a father and son who had filed a dowry complaint. The father and son had said that they were dragged out of their shops, and beaten up in public and at the police station before being arrested.

786,MELBOURNE,['34-year-old'],Melbourne residents wake up to Sushant Singh billboards across city,"MELBOURNE: Commuters in Melbourne were surprised to see several billboards “seeking justice” for a late Bollywood celebrity on the streets on Monday. The billboards with photos of Sushant Singh Rajput carried hashtags like #JusticeForSushantSinghRajput and were funded through an online campaign by the Indian diaspora in Australia. A fundraiser on a Facebook page created by Melbourne resident Divya Bakshi managed to raise approximately AUD 5000 (Rs 2.6 lakh) within five hours of being launched on August 13. The page has about 1,100 Indian-Australian members, many of whom made donations. “We wanted to set up the billboards to show support for a CBI probe into the matter,” Bakshi told TOI. The hoardings have been set up in seven locations across Melbourne. The 34-year-old actor was found dead in his Mumbai residence on June 14 and demands for an independent inquiry into his death have intensified over the past two months. The Bihar government has already recommended a CBI inquiry into the case and the Centre has notified it as well. Two petitions with the Supreme Court have also sought an order from the top court for a CBI probe. Anupama Arora, a healthcare worker in Melbourne who came up with the idea of the billboards and tied up with Bakshi to raise funds, told TOI that she had seen online pictures of billboards in support of the actor in the US. “I was not a die-hard fan of the actor or anything but his untimely death has affected people, mostly because he came from a simple background…people can relate to that.” Arora added that the Australian owner of the billboard company also gave them a discount when he was told about the message the Indian community was trying to send. Sudhir Juneja, another resident, got the posters for the billboards designed for free. “This meant we actually had leftover money which we used to help an Indian student who had lost his job during Covid-19,” said Arora.

Granting pre-arrest bails to teachers Sindhu Paul and Cresence Nevis, the court has asked them to appear before the investigating officer at 11am on November 17. They are also to be present before the officer between 10am and 4pm on November 18th, 19th, and 20th, the court directed. They are then required to appear on all Saturdays for one month. From then on, they need to appear only when the officer requires so, the court said. In the order granting anticipatory bails, the court said custodial interrogation is not required at present and no purpose would be served by sending them to jail now. They cannot be expected to commit a similar crime as they are teachers and don’t have criminal antecedents. It cannot also be expected that the petitioners, who were working at the same school for seven years, will try to escape from law, the court said in the order. Gowri’s father had opposed the anticipatory bail plea of the teachers and had contended that their custodial interrogation is necessary to bring out the truth regarding his daughter’s death. The allegation is that Gowri jumped from the third floor of an adjacent building after she was mentally harassed by the two teachers. Only the accused can explain what happened after Gowri was summoned from the class by them and the time she allegedly jumped off the building, the father’s petition had stated.

790,"The suicide of a girl student at an engineering college in Chennai, after she was allegedly caught copying, has brought to the fore the discussion on the burning issue of why our youngsters are not being able to handle pressure and resort to extreme steps the minute they are reprimanded for even the slightest misdemeanour. We speak to a cross-section of people from state educational officials to institutional heads to counsellors on the same. Social media, isolation within one’s home, pressure to complete course in stipulated time, helicopter parenting — there seem to be one too many reasons out there for the statistics to show an alarming rise as far as student suicides go. So, what gives? Social media, helicopter parenting put pressure on kidsOf late, on social media, many people always want to post things that project the best in them or their children. That result in putting unrealistic expectations on kids. That's the main problem. Secondly, we aren't teaching our kids how to handle failures in life. Earlier, when we were children, we were taught that the means mattered and not the end. But now, it's vice versa. In this case also, the same thing happened. She wanted to do well in the exam at any cost. Too much of helicopter parenting is another reason for putting unwanted pressure on students. A few years ago, the higher education department had initiated the Arts and Science colleges to have counsellors and may be soon, we can have them in engineering colleges as well. - Sunil Paliwal, IAS, Principal Secretary, Department of Higher Education Continuous communication between staff and students helpsThe kind of democratic setup we have in MCC helps us transfuse concerns, worries and anxieties, especially among the students. Also, we’ve student leaders in the decision-making body and therefore, there isn’t much room for any misunderstanding. Continuous communication between the staff and the students helps us sort out issues and find solutions smoothly. That ensures any untoward incidents. Also, considering the number of stress-related cases that we see these days, we have a full-time counsellor as well. - Dr RW Alexander Jesudasan, Principal, Madras Christian College Shame the wrong act he/ she did, not the individualAs a therapist, I feel that we've to be kind in the way we bring up an issue, especially when dealing with youngsters even if they're the ones at fault. These kinds of untoward things happen when the core of a person is disrespected for whatever reason it is. You must shame the wrong act he/she did, not the person. Many fail to differentiate between the two. Even to correct a person, we need not look straightaway at punishment. Also, what needs to be discussed is why an individual is being pressured to do something. In this case, she would have been under so much pressure to pass the exam. So, her intention had been to pass the exam somehow and it ended up this way Magdalene Jeyarathnam, Psychotherapist Blame it on the isolation within our own homesFrom my experience talking to psychiatrists, some people genetically have this tendency to commit suicide. Meanwhile, in my opinion, this isn’t a topic that should be discussed much. Because in some way or the other, that will give people such ideations when they’re pushed to a corner. Instead, let’s discuss stress management. And the best way to manage it is to talk to someone or call 104 helpline. In the last four years, there have been 1200 people who would have overcome suicide ideation after being counselled by us. There’s no way we can avoid pressure, but how we overcome pressure is what that matters. Also, if there’s a spurt in the number of suicides, blame it on the isolation that we face within our homes. Everyone is glued on to their mobile phones. — Counsellor from 104 helpline We need to build a proper, nurturing ecosystem for childrenThe family, society, education system and the technological advancement in terms of social media — all these have a cumulative effect on the individual. With social media dominating the web of life (of young adults specifically), the shame the person may have to carry for a minor misdeed amplifies multifold — and becomes a memory that doesn’t fade with time. Psychologists have confirmed that we are negativity-biased naturally. Social media seems to increase this vulnerability. Many a time, the individual has been trained or brought up in such a way as to be quite hard on his or her own self — to such an extent that they are not allowed to consider failure or shame as a feather that can be shed. Shame and failure do not come with the same yardstick for all individuals. It is usually not the teacher who’s at fault. Let me share my experience here — I went to the school my son studied at one day, so that the parent can observe the proceedings of the class. When asked a question, 80 hands were raised in a 40 student class, with a cry of ‘miss, miss’. So much was the enthusiasm to answer. All of them wanted to display their knowledge. When one of them told a wrong answer, the teacher moved on and the kids in the class also didn’t care about the wrong answer. It was over at that moment — and the student also never felt any kind of shame in having accidently uttered a wrong answer. Being a teacher myself, in one of the colleges where students are considered the cream of the country, when I tested the same method as above, trying to draw the attention of the class into answering a simple question, very few hands went up. These hands were of those who were very sure of their answers. For a long time, I did not understand why this shift. It was later, while dealing with troubled students, that I realised why students’ behaviour changes when they get into higher classes — it was all about maintaining their image among their friends and peers. The news about failure spreads fast — and this makes these students very touchy about erring. At IIT-M, we have one of the best Student Counselling Programs in India. We have come to believe in moderate and balanced involvement of parents to be an optimal way. Parents themselves seem to need a lot of counselling, as they often tend to unknowingly transfer their anxiety onto their kids, in the belief that they are providing them with a better future. Actually, we need to do a lot of work in terms of building an ecosystem right from home, school, work and retirement that nurtures the individual in terms of themselves, and helps them shed socially driven anxieties. — Professor Sivakumar M Srinivasan, Dean (Students), IIT Madras Students’ council needed in our collegesIn these places, there are hundreds of non-teaching staff who’ve no other job but to monitor students in hostels and ensure that they don’t gather in groups for any reason. There are no extracurricular activities in these deemed universities. Basically, it’s the fault with our education system. We need to restructure that. It’s high time that the University Grants Commission (UGC) checked on these deemed universities and the way they function. Also, students council need to be formed in colleges to address their issues. There’s nothing of that sort in our engineering campuses, especially in deemed universities. Now, Tamil Nadu is only second in India in the number of student suicides. In the last five years, close to 40,000 student suicides have happened across India. Several such suicides have happened in our deemed universities in the past. With their influence, they have been able to keep them under wraps. Now, it’s because of Anita suicide and its aftermath, such incidents are coming to light. — D Chandru, SFI south Chennai district president The punishment must be logicalChildren are so mentally fragile these days — I believe they are overprotected by their surroundings and they don’t know or want to accept failure. Another reason is that there is not enough communication when the students come to a new college; they don’t have friends in the first year, they don’t interact with others and feel lonely. I don’t know what the inside truth is, but going by the reports, if the girl was caught cheating in the examination hall, a mature teacher would have scrapped her paper and asked her to re-write the paper. They don’t need to verbally insult the student in the middle of the examination. But even if the teacher is questioning in the examination hall as to why the student did it, it is not wrong. Today, children are sensitive; they are not able to accept that they are doing something wrong. They do not like anyone questioning them and so is the case with parents these days. If a teacher scolds a student, they are questioned by the parents — ‘Why did you talk to my child like that?’ So, I don’t know where the problem lies exactly. From my experience, I can say that if the students feel and trust whatever their teachers do is for their own good, they won’t protest. But teachers must be mature, behave, and the punishment should be logical. —TV Geetha, Dean, College of Engineering, Anna University There’s unwanted pressure on students to complete course in four years Pressure is there from both the parents and peers. No matter what, parents want their children to excel in higher studies within a stipulated time and get a lucrative job. Our education system and society are giving too much importance to trivial matters; for example, completing a professional course in four years and doing things only the way it is defined. But if you take the case in the world’s most developed countries like America, government expects the students to finish a course in 150% of the time. If it’s a four-year course, the number of students completing the course in that stipulated time is very less. And the students there don’t feel pressured. Also, when they are caught copying in front of their peers, they fear that their parents will come to know about it and they will be left in embarrassment. Because these students would be coming from the same neighbourhood and their families would know each other. With every parent boasting so much about their wards’ achievements, this would be an embarrassment. Another thing is that we only focus on the incident, but fail to discuss the root causes. Lastly, it should also be noted that there’s a general perception and talk even among parents that private university education is commercialised. So, such feeling creeps into the minds of students as well and they will not pay attention to teachers. They see us as a commercial entity and give no value to our words. — Koteswararao Anne, Director of academics, Veltech University",[],Why is the first and last resort suicide?,"The suicide of a girl student at an engineering college in Chennai, after she was allegedly caught copying, has brought to the fore the discussion on the burning issue of why our youngsters are not being able to handle pressure and resort to extreme steps the minute they are reprimanded for even the slightest misdemeanour.

Srinivasan, a Class XII student, hanged himself in his bedroom, when he was alone at home. Police said the boy had been growing his hair for more than three months and had refused to cut it short. Despite his mother's repeated objections, he refused to obey her.

792,KOCHI,[],"Student suicide case: Teachers' interrogation required, father tells HC","KOCHI: Custodial interrogation of two teachers of Trinity Lyceum Higher Secondary School of Kollam who are accused of abetting the alleged suicide of class 10th student Gowri Nekha is needed to bring out the truth, the student’s father has demanded before the Kerala High Court. Gowri’s father R Prasannakumar of Kavanad in Kollam has filed a petition opposing the anticipatory bail pleas filed by the accused teachers, Sindhu Paul and Cresence Nevis. Gowri had allegedly jumped from the third floor of the adjacent building after she was mentally harassed by the two teachers. Stressing on the need for arrest and custodial interrogation of the teachers, the petition said, “It is learnt from other students who were with Gouri that the accused teachers came and took the deceased with them without allowing her to have her lunch. It is understood that CCTV footage also support this. Thereafter she did not return to the classroom. The school authorities are now saying that she jumped from the 3rd floor of another building. What happened in between? Even assuming that she jumped, what prompted or compelled her to do so? Only the accused can explain this.” It is alleged by Gowri’s father that police is not taking any effective steps to apprehend or interrogate the accused teachers owing to the undue influence exerted by the school management. Unless the teachers are subjected to custodial interrogation, the truth will never come out, the father’s plea said. The petition also said a special class was convened for Gowri’s class on the next day of the incident and students were told not to give statements to police without the presence of school authorities. “I genuinely apprehend that probably the investigating agency may not disclose all the real facts before this Hon’ble Court due to the undue influence and pressure of the management of the school so as to avoid the custodial interrogation of the accused teachers,” the petition by the father said while seeking permission to join in the case.

795,KOLKATA,[],Kolkata sees 25 per cent dip in suicides: NCRB,"KOLKATA: Physical illness and depression are the biggest reasons behind suicides in the city, though there are also some other personal reasons like physical abuse, love affairs, drug abuse and unwanted pregnancy, according to the National Crime Records Bureau data for 2018, released recently. Total number of suicides in the city took a 25% dip from 216 persons in 2017 to 162 persons in 2018, though the state took a reverse path in this regard. In 2017, 12,014 people committed suicide across the state while the number took nearly 10.3% jump with 13,255 suicides in 2018. According to the NCRB sources, failure in examinations led six young women to commit suicide in 2018 when total 779 students ended their lives across the state. The number of girls committing suicide is more than boys in the state. As per the data, 436 girls and 343 boys were among the suicide victims, mostly students. Of 914 young professionals who committed suicide in the state, 223 were women. Fifty-four of them were from Kolkata. Physical illness drove 76 persons in the city to end their lives and 67 of them were men, including eight cancer and three paralysis patients. Of 63 mentally challenged suicide victims, 54 were men. Futile love affairs led to 11 suicides while illicit affair, unwanted pregnancy and physical abuse on women prompted 14 persons to take the extreme step of killing themselves in the city. According to Lalbazar sources, an analysis of suicides committed in 2018 and 2019 has revealed that the victims are of two age groups like 20-29 years and 30-45 years. Maximum cases have been reported from the added areas where the pressure on young people to get jobs is more because of their economic conditions, said a detective department officer who had carried out the analysis with psychiatrists in last month. “According to studies, 90% of the suicide cases are related to depression. In majority of the suicide cases, the victims are aged between 19 and 29 years. Depression is a silent killer. We need to talk about depression and other mental illness more often, so that the stigma attached with the ailment can be driven away. Those suffering from the illness can seek professional help before it is too late,” Pradeep Saha, director Institute of Psychiatry (IOP) at IPGMER, SSKM Hospital, told TOI a couple of days ago. “When people are aged between 30 and 45 years, they start to re-evaluate themselves on their achievements and the aspirations they have not been able to meet. The key factor in a suicide case is the feeling of helplessness. When one feels that he or she has not achieved enough and the prospects are not good, this can make them feel helpless, forcing them to take a drastic step like suicide,” said psychiatrist, J R Ram.

The students abused each other and the teacher came to know about the fight that took place in the classroom. The teacher made me sit in front of the teacher’s desk for the entire day. Because of this, I am ending my life.” Shubham’s father works as a contract labourer with Ordinance Factory in Dehu Road and his mother is a housewife. He left home on Tuesday evening for his private coaching class in Dehu village. After class, he told his friends that he was going towards Vitthalnagar for some work, police said.

Police said the boy — a Class-XII commerce student of a reputable English medium school in central Kolkata — had been sick and hadn’t eaten much for the last three days. On Monday, the family had called for an ambulance to take him to a hospital. But minutes before the ambulance arrived, the boy went to the bathroom and reportedly jumped from the window.

As many as 30 suicides were reported in the city lockdown. Clinical psychology and psychiatry experts told TOI that fear, loneliness, anxiety and depression have been driving people to take the extreme step. “According to a report compiled by a group of activists, suicide was the leading cause in 338 ‘non-coronavirus deaths’ in the country from March 19 to May 2. In Prayagraj alone, 30 cases of suicides took place between March 23 and May 28,” said Dr Ishanya Raj, clinical psychologist at Motilal Nehru Divisional hospital. “Covid-19 is causing concern, stress, depression, anxiety and suicidal tendency among people all over the world. It is also impacting the psychological well-being of general public. Elders, students, healthcare professionals, females, labourers, people living in stress and those with chronic conditions are at higher risk,” she added. “Studies conducted to find out reasons for people taking this extreme step during pandemic show that unpredictability, fear of getting infected, physical distancing, break in normal routine, lack of mental stimulation from social interaction, restrictions on movement are some of the main contributory factors,” said Dr Raj. People must stay positive in this time and should find ways to ward off negativity. There are several tips one can follow. “Everyone should practice yoga, meditation, do physical exercises like aerobics, walking or jogging at home, spend time with family, take care of children and elders, connect with relatives and friends, read, learn something new, pursue a hobby, finish pending work, schedule activities, and involve themselves in household responsibilities, she added. “Writing down feelings or using any other creative form to express feelings, instead of focusing on fear are good ways. People should get good sleep, limit watching news, limit internet time,” Dr Raj added. “One should not hesitate in seeking professional help. Experts can help handle such situations,” said Dr Rajesh Paswan of the hospital. Dr Jayanath BP, consultant psychiatrist, district hospital, Kaushambi said, “The loss of jobs, reduced income and uncertainty about future are causing anxiety and distress.

The teen’s father had gifted him the gadget about a month ago.

After getting their demands fulfilled more easily than in yesteryears, the present generation seems to have become more prone to react adversely to anything not happening as per their wish,” he said. “The impulsivity in children is likely driving them to take such steps. We need wise parenting as one of the tools to avoid such tragedies,” he said. In the first case, the 11-year-old is learnt to have taken Rs 10 from home without informing parents and had purchased a samosa with it. His elder brother informed their mother about his brother’s taking away the money and buying samosa. He had also snatched the samosa from younger sibling and eaten it. The family is poor and the victim’s father makes ends meet by selling vegetables. Though their mother permitted younger son to buy another samosa, he went inside the kitchen and hanged himself.

808,KOLKATA,[],"City life 'selfish', student wrote in note; cops smell suicide","KOLKATA: Police and relatives of Asutosh Mondal (18), a first-year student of a top central Kolkata college who reportedly fell to death from his fourth-floor Beliaghata flat on Sunday afternoon, believe that he might have committed suicide. They suspect that Mondal took the extreme step after being ""unable to adapt himself to the demands of city life"". Police have now recovered a four-page note written by him that they believe is the 'suicide note'. It showed that Mondal was distraught after he had to shift to the Khoda Gunge Road flat in Beliaghata four months ago from Birbhum's Mallarpur to pursue higher studies. Mondal found his new friends and the city ""selfish"". In the recent past, Mondal rued the move and expressed his wish to stay in Birbhum and study with his school friends there. ""The suicide note that we recovered shows how he was feeling out of place. It also mentions that his mother, too, was not happy when he came to Kolkata four months ago. His father is a BSF official and his life mostly revolved around his mother,"" said a senior police officer. Asutosh's sister Jyoti, who rushed to Kolkata from Ahmedabad, said her brother was soft-spoken and would rarely open up in front of strangers. ""He was not happy after shifting here. He always felt that he was being taken advantage of. He mentioned his new friends, but did not talk about anyone bullying him. He was also worried about the indisciplined lifestyles of some of his classmates,"" she said. Mondal's neighbours - Rahima Bibi, who saw his body stuck in the spear-like protrusions on the main gate, and Tapas Mitra, who called local youths to rush him to NRS Hospital - said the boy never showed any signs of frustration. He was quiet and mostly kept to himself. Police earlier suspected that Mondal might have fallen off the balcony while talking on his mobile. But the note has changed their perspective. ""We shall still wait for the post-mortem report. However, now it seems more like a case of suicide,"" said a Beliaghata police officer. The cops said they were going through Mondal's recent social media data. He had recently updated his status on WhatsApp where he called humans ""selfish creatures"". ""The information will help us ascertain the reason behind his death,"" a senior officer said.

Justice Kuldeep Singh of the HC has handed over the probe to Dhillon, who is at present posted as IG Hisar range, after CBI had expressed inability to investigate the case for being overburdened and suggested that investigation may be handed over to some upright officer of the state police. Haryana police have already filed untraced report in this case before the trial court. The matter had reached before the HC after deceased girl’s father Beerpal Chauhan had filed a petition before the HC seeking independent probe in the case. His contentions were that statement of Pinki was videographed and formed the basis of FIR but certain facts were omitted in FIR. He had also produced a video clip in a pen drive which was played in the court, which was a news item, wherein Pinki was seen stating that the match box was given to her by ‘madam’. Counsel for the petitioner had contended that since four teachers against whom there are allegations are the wives of the IAS officers, there are chances that they may influence the investigation. The case has been fixed for further hearing on March 8. The 19-year-old student had set fire to herself on her college campus in Gurgaon on September 29, 2015, to protest faulty marksheets. She had died in Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital on October 12, 2015. The case had hit the headlines in the Millennium City after the deceased’s family had levelled serious allegations against the staff of college for driving her to take extreme step.

813,KOCHI,[],Experts question Kerala government’s data as officials flag rising trend,"KOCHI: The chief minister’s recent statement that 66 children below 18 years of age committed suicide during the lockdown period from March 25 has sent shockwaves through the state. Among the state’s robust child-welfare networks there is a deafening silence, as the government’s number just doesn’t tally with their own. In a state where every unusual death involving a child is discussed threadbare in all circles, including news and social media, the number has left most flummoxed, unable to counter for want of better data and unable to accept that one child died every two days in the last 108 days in the state! Official sources say most of the deaths were among children in their late teens between 16 and 18 years of age. They stress that the number also includes attempted suicides. However, renowned psychiatrist Dr C J John refutes the claim, saying that since suicide has been decriminalized attempted suicides need not be reported. “It is not mandatory for hospitals to report them. If we go by the data put out by the chief minister, then the frequency of suicides works out to roughly one death every two days. It was not flagged by any agency government or NGO. We didn’t have any such reports in the media even though death by suicide is generally reported. This also, when several other deaths were discussed on public platforms and the media. The government’s figure does not tally with the known number of suicides,” said Dr John, who also works with Maithri – an NGO working on preventing suicides. Dr John said that for better understanding it is important that details be made available to policy planners, which should include professionals and experts. “If one were to look at the psychosocial support (PSS) data, around 64,286 calls were made by counsellors and 10,299 children were given counselling. The data shows stress (3,084), anxiety (2,905), behavioural issues (311) but only seven calls suggesting suicidal behaviour. Tools must be devised to reach out to children. The ‘Chiri’ project – which employs student police cadets (SPC) for primary-level intervention is ridiculous. You are asking a child to counsel another child. Do they have the maturity or training to handle it? At best, they can function as a peer group,” Dr John said. State officials admit the number is very disturbing. “We were discussing a few suicides that had happened when we asked the police for data. However, the increase in suicides among children below 18 is not a new pattern. There have been reports by Childline and Unicef flagging the issue. In the last nearly one-and-a-half years there have been about 300 such suicides reported in the state,” T V Anupama, director, women and child department. The social justice, women and child development department and the state mental health authority will analyze the cases to understand and work out a policy for prevention and intervention.

The victim, Piue Ghosh, who was from of West Bengal, left a moving ‘I Quit’ on the wall of her residence. Gandhinagar police are yet to ascertain the reason behind her extreme step. IIT-Gn officials remained tight-lipped about the incident and attempts to reach Prof Sudhir Jain, the institute director, through phone and email yielded no results. A statement from the IIT-Gn public relations team read, “The incident is currently under investigation by police and the institute is committed to fully cooperating with them. We are unable to release any information or comment while the investigation is under way.” The response identified Ghosh as a PhD scholar at the electric engineering department of the institute. M H Solanki, the sub-inspector with Chiloda police station who is investigating the case, told TOI that Ghosh had hanged herself at her quarters on the campus. “She had written ‘I quit’ and a few more lines on a wall, directing that her belongings be given to the needy and her organs donated,” he said. “Apart from this writing on the wall, no note on paper in digital format has been found that could be considered a suicide note,” he added. Solanki said the statements of her family and faculty members are yet to be recorded. “Her parents are based in West Bengal and her husband is in the US,” he said. Sources privy to the developments said Ghosh had returned to the campus from her parents’ home only recently. Due to the lockdown and subsequent online classes, only a few students are living on the campus. They added that her postmortem report is yet to arrive through which the precise time of death could be known. “It is possible that her suicide occurred a couple of days before the body was found,” a police source said. Ghosh’s profile on the IIT-Gn website identifies her as doctoral student writing her thesis on the subject ‘Synthesis of gold nanorods with tunable surface plasmon resonance for the development of a bio-chemical sensing platform’ under Prof Arup Lal Chakraborty. Her project aimed at designing a biomolecular sensor for simultaneous detection of multiple biomolecules. She had completed her BTech and MTech from Calcutta University before taking admission in IIT-Gn for its doctoral programme in 2015.

816,BHOPAL,[],3-pronged strategy to curb student suicide,"BHOPAL: Worried over a spike in student suicides, police, school education and health department authorities have worked out a strategy to put a curb on such incidents. And the three departments are working in close coordination to prevent students or youths from taking the extreme step on the spur of the moment or otherwise. The helplines of the three government agencies, police dial 100, child line 1098 and medical 104 will work as a cohesive unit to extend assistance in every possible manner to save life. The state government had set up an assembly committee last year to prepare guidelines for schools to check suicidal tendencies among students and ensure compulsory sports classes. The panel submitted its report, but recommendations are yet to be implemented. Constant rise in students’ suicide in the state prompted the state government to take steps to put a curb on it. Numbers — suicides in MP increased by 250% since 2004—present a disturbing picture. A high-level meeting was held at state secretariat on Wednesday wherein discussion centred around ways to implement recommendations. And recommendations are likely to be implemented soon. Anvesh Manglam, ADG (telecommunication), said the government agencies would coordinate and work to stop students from committing suicide. How the model will work and details like standard operating procedures (SOP) are being worked out. Another meeting is scheduled next week. Once agencies agree, the government will issue the order, he said. Officials said different agencies have different roles. Like police can track a youth, but cannot do psychological counselling to dissuade them from taking such a step. Likewise, a teacher can address students issues better and doctors in case of a medical urgency. If all three work in sync to address the issue of a student before he or she makes an attempt or immediately after that, the issue can be addressed to some extent, officials said. The House committee found out the number of students from government schools committing suicide is higher than those from private ones. “It is noticed all these years, a large number of students committing suicide belonged to middle-class families. Besides, number of students from rural areas taking the extreme step is higher compared to their urban counterparts,” the report revealed.

818,CHANDIGARH,[],School bullies behind suicidal teens in Chandigarh: Expert,"CHANDIGARH: Besides unfulfilled ambitions and failed relationships, school bullies are also a major source of anxiety, frustration, and depression in suicidal teenagers. Adolescent health experts keep receiving these cases. Counsellor Chhaya Prasad, who runs a parental skills guidance clinic, has found children with problem of speech articulation, mispronunciation, and learning disability to be soft targets of bullies in their class. She advises parents to have regular communication with their teenaged children to bring them out of this dejection. Her clinic has adopted six government schools for child awareness. She said: “Symptoms of bullying are in child’s falling attendance, quietness, isolation, bursts of anger, and deteriorating handwriting. If parents interact with their children, they can spot these common signs easily and confront this problem at the initial stage. Spend quality time with children every day to build up their confidence. Talk to them about their friends, teachers, bus driver, and other people they meet. Scan their notebooks daily and consult development pediatricians, if need be.” Between 2015 and 2019, 81 teenagers committed suicide in the city. The grim figures have prompted experts to ask parents, teachers, siblings and friends to look out for warning signs such as poor eating habits, depression, short temper, and mood swings. Psychiatrists at Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, list six reasons why children kill self—academic pressure, frequent break-ups in relationships, poor tolerance and aggression, lack of parental attention, alcohol abuse, and easy access to means of suicide such as firearms. ‘Schools can help detect troubled child’Hanging is the most common mode of suicide, followed by consuming poisonous substances and jumping into lake or off the buildings. Experts say that schools can play a major role in detecting whether a child is troubled or not. On its part, the UT administration has appointed counsellors in government schools to help students cope up with examination stress and observe the signs of suicidal tendencies. They give regular special lectures on stress management to the students of classes V to XII and monitor each of them. During parent-teacher meetings, they tell parents about keeping their wards relaxed. A few years ago, online game Blue Whale was blamed for many suicides among children in the country. In this challenge, a designated curator assigns players tasks over a 50-day period, culminating in the player's committing suicide, for real.

Multiple reasons are cited for children taking the drastic step. Dr B S Chavan, psychiatrist, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, lists six — academic pressure, frequent break-ups in relationships, poor tolerance and aggression, parents not paying attention, alcohol abuse and easy access to means of suicide, like firearms. Professor Adarsh Kohli, a clinical psychologist, PGI, called frustration owing to unfulfilled ambitions and failed relationships the key reasons behind teen suicides — the most (25) took place in 2017. Eighteen children took their lives in 2015, 11 in 2016, 12 in 2018 and 15 last year, according to the data.

During parent-teacher meetings, parents are told about not putting undue pressure on their wards for studies, she said. Counsellors said they also receive cases of bullying among the students by their classmates or friends. Bullying leads to distress and anxiety among children and can drive some of the children to suicide, experts said.

Manuj Mehta was a final-year computer science engineering student of Northcap University. He lived with his step father and mother at Uniworld Garden in Sector 47. Around 5.10 pm on Friday, Manuj is believed to have gone to the terrace of the building of his house and jumped off. He lived with his parents on the third floor. After Manuj fell on the ground, a security guard stationed on the premises saw his body and informed the estate office. Soon his mother was informed. By the time, the police had also arrived. He was taken to a nearby private hospital, but was declared brought dead. Police said Manuj’s body has been handed over to his family members after an autopsy on Saturday. A resident of the society, who did not wish to be named, said Manuj had been suffering from depression which might have been the cause of his decision to kill self. However, no suicide note has been found. Sources told TOI that Manuj had stopped going to the university since last April and was undergoing treatment for depression. A police officer investigating the case said that no FIR had been registered as there was no reason to suspect foul play. “The proceedings were made under Section 174 of CrPC (police to enquire and report on suicide),” he said. (An earlier version of this report had erroneously stated that the student jumped from the university building. The error is regretted.)

825,KOCHI,[],Abetting student's suicide: HC grants pre-arrest bail to Nehru College chairman,"KOCHI: The Kerala high court on Thursday granted anticipatory bail to P Krishnadas, managing trustee and chairman of Nehru Group of Institutions, in the case over suicide of BTech student Jishnu Pranoy. Krishnadas is the first accused in the case and is booked for abetment. While granting anticipatory bail, a single bench of the court said prosecution has not been able to present any material to show Krishnadas instigated Jishnu to commit suicide. However, the case against the vice principal, invigilator, and other officers of Nehru College of Engineering of Thrissur who are accused in the case stands on a different footing as there is evidence that they subjected the deceased to cruelty, the court said. Even assuming that the college authorities wanted to suppress any attempt on the part of students to form a union in the college and that they wanted to nip in the bud any resistance by students to their illegal or irregular attempts, it cannot be taken into account in the present case, the judgment said. A general allegation is not sufficient to attract section 107 (abetment) or section 306 (abetment of suicide) and direct evidence that the petitioner was actively involved in instigating the deceased is required, the court pointed out. Statements of witnesses does not reveal that the petitioner had any role in torturing the deceased or that he was directly or indirectly involved in the alleged torture that took place in the college, the judgment said. Prosecution had alleged that the college authorities used to maintain a ‘torture room’ where students whom they wanted to be disciplined were brought and tortured. The court was also told that bloodstains in the ‘torture room’ were cleaned before the investigation started. But the court said these general allegations are not sufficient to attract the offence of instigation or abetment to suicide against the petitioner. The instigation allegedly made by the accused and the commission of suicide by the deceased must be proximate, the court said, while adding that prosecution has not been able to collect any evidence to show that the petitioner suggested to the deceased to commit suicide or that he did something which was proximate to the commission of suicide.

826,Pilibhit,['16-year-old'],Two students commit suicide in separate incidents in Pilibhit,"Pilibhit: Two teenage boys committed suicide in two different incidents in Pilibhit. While the reason behind the first suicide is not known, a heartbreak is suspected to be the reason behind the other.

In the first case, a 16-year-old student of class 10, Mayank Gangwar, hanged himself in his house in Bisalpur town. The reason as to why he took the step is not yet known. According to Madho Singh Visht, SHO of Bisalpur Kotwali police station, the boy returned home from Radha Madha Public School, Bareilly, on Saturday afternoon, and entered his room as usual. When he didn’t emerge from his room for his tuition classes in the evening on Saturday, his family members went to check and found him hanging from the ceiling fan. “On request of Gajendra Kumar, Mayank’s father, who is a teacher in local SRM Inter College, the police did not send the dead body for post mortem,” the SHO said.

Ravi’s father, Shankar Lal, a farmer and a mini rice plant owner, simply filed written information about his son’s suicide. Police suspect a love affair gone wrong to be the reason behind the incident, the SHO said. “We have sent the dead body for autopsy and we will closely examine the report concerned to find out whether it was a case of suicide or some criminal act,” Singh added.

830,NEW DELHI,[],Mental health experts highlight role of 'Gatekeepers' in suicide prevention,"NEW DELHI: Every year one of the premiere mental health institutions – the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences (IHBAS) based in the national Capital sees anywhere between 150 to 180 patients classified as high risk to suicides. They are now following up on the cases of 144 high risk patients who were treated between July 2018 to June 2019. The idea is to bring focus on not just early treatment of mental health issues like depression but the need for gatekeepers within the family and community who have the potential to prevent attempts of suicide. In many cases, where a person with suicidal thoughts did not attempt suicide, IHBAS director, Dr Nimesh Desai said they found that three key protective factors – integrated families, social and spiritual support, playing a critical role in prevention. Experts caution that hints that a person may attempt suicide are always there and therefore those around must be alert to them for timely action. Practitioners are now drawing attention to the role of gatekeepers. Infact, the idea of a gatekeeper is strongly emphasised in a manual available on the website of the directorate general of health services of the ministry of health. For training of facilitators down to the district level, the manual titled “Living Life Positively” states that similar to CPR (Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) which saves life if an individual has stopped breathing, a simple method -QPR (Question, Persuade and Refer) can help save many lives by preventing suicide. This involves exploring if someone has thoughts and plans about suicide, persuading him/her to seek help and guiding them to a referral so that the individual gets timely help. While emphasising on prevention through early intervention, Professor Pratap Sharan from AIIMS department of psychiatry said that studies showthat suicides are higher among young women in their 20s and early 30s in India when compared to the western countries where there are more cases among older men. This needs more in-depth study to work on preventive strategies. He also pointed that the maximum cases of death by suicide are caused by organophosphorus poisoning in India and therefore there for policies to regulate the sale and storage of pesticides. Recognising the challenges, AIIMS has also set-up a task force in the department of psychiatry in the backdrop of cases of their own fraternity from AIIMS dying by suicide over the years. They are working on a strategy to mitigate the factors and focus on prevention. According to sources, over the decade, almost one or two cases of death by suicide involving AIIMS fraternity – including mostly resident doctors and undergraduate medical students have been reported every year. This year there have been three cases – one resident doctor, a researcher and one student, sources said. Meanwhile, the ministry of social justice launched a 24x7 mental health rehabilitation helpline on Monday named “KIRAN” (1800-500-0019). Steered by the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPwD), the inclusive helpline is reflective of the signs of the current times. In the face of growing incidence of mental illness in the backdrop of Covid-19 pandemic the government feels it will fill the gap, as so far, there was absence of a universal dedicated helpline in respect of rehabilitation services for mental illness, to provide first stage counselling and advice.

837,CHANDIGARH,"['70-year-old', '70-year-old']",Punjab Covid-19: It's still scary,"CHANDIGARH: It was just about a year ago that Punjab reported its first confirmed case of Covid-19 on March 5. Over the past 367 days, the state has registered 5,927 deaths due to the virus and 1,88,391 infections. Lockdown to contain the contagious virus changed the way people live. Even today, the Covid situation remains uncertain in the state as cases have started to resurge. Vinod Kumar looks back at the year of the pandemic. A (Amritsar) | Punjab detected its first case on March 5, 2020, in Amritsar. The patient, a resident of Hoshiarpur district, had returned from Italy and tested positive at the airport. He recovered after completing his isolation period. B (Biomedical Waste) | Apart from controlling the spread of cases, Punjab faced a daunting challenge of scientific disposal of virus-laden biomedical waste. The health facilities engaged in treating Covid-19 patients in Punjab, one of the worst-hit states in the country, generated about 1,148 tonnes of waste by February 28 this year. Elaborate arrangements have been made for the disposal of Covid waste in a scientific manner. C (Contact Tracing) | Strict contact tracing of positive cases and isolation of infected people is the key to reducing the spread of the pandemic. In the first few months, contact tracing of cases was not up to the mark. After sustained efforts, there was an improvement and the state’s overall tracing ratio is 15 contacts per positive case against the desirable ratio of tracing 10 contacts per case. D (Death Toll) | So far, 5,898 people have died of Covid in Punjab, highlighting the administration’s inability to save valuable lives. A 70-year-old man from Nawanshahr district was the first victim of the virus. Last year, August and September turned out to be the worst months in the state, accounting for 2,942 deaths. E (Education) | The total closure of schools, universities and colleges took a toll on education. The closure led to the forced replacement of physical classrooms with online education, further widening the prevailing social inequalities. Lack of internet connections, smartphones and computers, emerged as a major hurdle for students. The maximum brunt of the closure of physical classrooms was faced by students from underprivileged sections. In three separate tragic incidents, students committed suicide apparently for not being able to attend online classes for want of smartphone. To minimise the damaging impact of closures on schoolchildren, the education department took measures like broadcasting lessons on Doordarshan. F (Fatality rate) | Punjab has the highest death rate of 3.20%, which is more than twice the all-India average. It is the only state with a fatality rate of over 3%. There has been a consistent drop in the national Covid-19 fatality rate from 3.36% in mid-July to 1.4% on March 5. During the same period, Punjab’s death rate went up from 2.41% to 3.2%. The case fatality rate of Maharashtra, which earlier was worse than Punjab, has come down to 2.4%. G (Gurdaspur incident of assault on health workers) | Health workers were attacked in Gurdaspur after reporting the arrival of migrant labourers in a village. There have been several instances of medical teams/ sampling teams being manhandled in different districts and cases of resistance to shifting Covid positive patients to isolation facilities. These incidents forced health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu to issue a warning of strict action against those attacking health workers. H (Heath Care Infrastructure) | Covid outbreak has unwittingly helped the state government improve its ailing health infrastructure. A lot of improvements have been made to effectively fight the Covid-19 outbreak. To ensure that no patient was denied treatment, as many as 5,238 Level II Hospital beds with oxygen support were set up in the government facilities and 2,673 in the private facilities. A total of 1,530 ICU beds, including 645 beds with ventilator support, were also set up. Vacant posts of doctors and technical staff in the government hospitals were filled. As many as 107 specialist doctors, 498 medical officers and 32 dental officers were hired. In addition, 102 radiographers, 52 OT technicians and 90 laboratory technicians were also recruited. I (Industry) | Already struggling for survival, the Covid outbreak spelt doom for the industry in Punjab. The industrial sector faced a minimum estimated loss of Rs 40,000 crore due to waste of 482 man-days because of the Covid-19 lockdown. Out of 633.88 lakh MSMEs in India, Punjab has about 14.65 lakh enterprises. A large number of textile units used their capacity for alternate use during the curfew period by manufacturing PPE kits, full body cover suit with helmets, gloves and face shields, as per prescribed standards. J (Job losses) | Restrictions imposed to contain Covid brought economic activities to a grinding halt for almost two months and pushed a large number of people out of work. Punjab CM had in May 2020 estimated around 10 lakh people had lost jobs due to the lockdown. The Punjab government later took the initiative to register, counsel and train the jobless to help them find work and rev up the industrial activity. K (kits) | To ensure all patients get proper medical care, the state government started giving a kit, costing Rs 1,700 each, containing an oximeter, digital thermometer, face mask, gloves, and medicines to positive patients since September. L (lockdown) | Punjab was the first state in the country to impose a complete lockdown on March 23 last year. The lockdown was enforced under Section 144 of the CrPC with the exemption of some essential services, forcing people to stay indoors and take proper precautionary measures. Over 45,000 police personnel and 12,000 civil volunteers were deployed as a frontline force. During the period, over 20 lakh calls were received on the 24x7 emergency helpline number 112 and more than 22 lakh curfew e-pass requests were received. Fines to the tune of Rs 15 crore were imposed for not wearing masks, spitting in public places and not maintaining social distancing. M (migrant) | Migrant workers were the hardest hit by the pandemic as they faced several hardships. Punjab came to their rescue by providing them food and space to stay and facilitated more than 4.5 lakh migrants to reach their homes. Nodal officers were appointed to coordinate with their counterparts in other states and to liaise with the railway authorities to plan and schedule trains based on the inputs from the field. The rail fare of close to Rs 35 crore was paid by the state government. N (Nawanshahr) | Nawanshahr was the first epicentre of the pandemic in Punjab after a 70-year-old man was tested positive on his return from Italy and Germany. After his return, he came in contact with at least 90 others, who came in contact with hundreds of more people. The district became the first containment zone and all 15 villages of the Banga subdivision were sealed and Section 144 was imposed. An estimated 30,000 people were placed in home quarantine. At least 27 people contracted the virus from him, including 18 of his family members and residents of his village. He later died of Covid on March 18, becoming the first victim of the virus in the state. O (Oxygen Of Life!) | Steep surge in cases in August and September last year pushed the demand for medical oxygen through the roof, creating a panic-like situation. The demand had touched about 130 metric tonnes (MT), forcing Punjab to impose restrictions on state-based manufacturers for selling it to other states and directed them to give priority to home demand. To ensure an uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen to hospitals for treating critically ill patients, the government had also imposed restrictions on the supply of oxygen to industrial units. P (Private Players) | Private health centres are playing a crucial role in the fight against the pandemic. To meet the demand for health infrastructure, the cash-strapped state government is relying heavily on private facilities, especially for Level-III beds. Of these1,530 Level-III beds, 1,144 are in the private sector and there are 386 beds to treat critically-ill patients in government hospitals. The government’s 20-member task force in its report recommended roping in private hospitals to tackle Covid-19. Q (quarantine centres) | To isolate infected people, Punjab arranged 8,000 beds at 24 level-I quarantine centres across the state. After high occupancy in the initial months, there was a drastic drop in the number of patients opting for institutional isolation due to the easing of norms for home isolation. The government later closed all Level-I centres. R (Rumours) | Rumours and misinformation about the pandemic and its treatment created panic among the rural population, hampering the government’s efforts in the first few months of the outbreak. Negative campaigns on social media were launched, alleging illegal harvesting of organs from bodies of coronavirus patients and doctors were accused of falsely declaring people Covid-positive. Some of the elected representatives were also involved in spreading misleading information. Punjab Police booked Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) MLA Simarjit Singh Bains for allegedly inciting people against wearing masks and misleading them on Covid-19. S (Sero survey) | All the serological surveys conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the state government in Punjab painted a grim picture of the Covid outbreak. In the last survey conducted in December and January, as many as 19.45% of the covered population was found to have contracted the virus and recovered. The percentage of people found exposed to the highly contagious virus in the last survey was higher than the findings of the second survey conducted by IMCR in September. During the second survey, 11.26% were found exposed to the virus. T (Testing) | After struggling to get going in the initial months, Punjab made progress on testing, a key factor in controlling the spread of infection by identifying suspected cases early. From four tests per million population on March 16 last year to 17, 0015 tests per million population on March 5 against the national average of 162,716 tests per million population, Punjab has come a long way. The initial capacity of 40 tests per day in each laboratory has increased to over 26,500 RTPCR tests in seven government laboratories. A total of 46 private labs have also come up. U (Underlying health conditions) | Underlying health conditions, ageing population and delay in seeking treatment are key reasons for the high fatality rate in the state. The government data reveals that in about 85% of deaths, patients had underlying health conditions. Diabetes was the common high-risk factor and most of the deceased had uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Other co-morbidities found commonly include hypertension, heart disease, kidney disease and lung ailments. An extensive house-to-house surveillance was carried out last year and covered population above 40 years to identify persons with co-morbidities with Covid symptoms. V (Vaccination) | Punjab has evoked a lukewarm response to the much-awaited Covid vaccination drive. Vaccination is seen by experts as an important tool to help stop the pandemic. Since the launch of the drive on January 16, Punjab is among the worst-performing states with only 178,371 health workers and frontline workers getting vaccinated. Only 23,609 beneficiaries have been covered in the third phase. Punjab Asha workers’ union had officially announced that they would not take the vaccine in the first phase. There are about 21,000 Asha workers in the state. So far, only 90 cases of adverse events following immunisation (AEFI ) have been reported among health and frontline workers. W (Waves of Covid cases) | Punjab has so far witnessed multiple waves of cases after the first positive case was reported in March 2020. The first wave was related to people coming from aboard, followed by members of Tablighi Jamaat. Then a series of cases emerged from Jawaharpur village in the Mohali district, followed by cases related to Jalandhar-based vernacular newspaper and hookah party in Rajpura. Another wave of cases was reported when pilgrims returned from Nanded in Maharashtra after spending about 40 days there. X (X factor) | Punjab developed a digital application, COVA to cater to the needs of essential sectors, especially the health sector. The application proved beneficial for the integration of aspects such as contact tracing and geo-fencing. The government used a digital platform to regulate the migrant labour movement, employment generation, agricultural procurement and education. Y (Yeoman service) | Punjab received appreciable support from ‘Good Samaritans’ and government employees in the fight against the virus. To contain and manage the pandemic, health workers, frontline workers, police personnel, revenue officials and other government employees did a commendable job. In the process, 34 government employees succumbed to the virus. Several NGOs and religious groups distributed food among needy people across the state and volunteer groups helped perform the last rites of Covid victims. Z (Zones, containment) | To tackle the spread of the virus, Punjab identifies zones – clusters, micro-containment zones and large outbreak zones – where corrective steps are taken. The sealing of clusters and containment zones is being done in a systematic manner. Such areas are sealed and restrictions are imposed on the movement of people. Extensive four-level contact tracing is done by the health teams through door-to-door surveys in these notified areas. Those who test positive are isolated from the population. During the peak, about 200 areas having about 2 lakh population were identified as high priority zones for checking the spread of the virus. As of March 5, there are 14 such zones in the state ",08-03-2021,"['virus', 'infections', 'contagious', 'virus', 'uncertain', 'isolation', 'daunting', 'waste', 'waste', 'waste', 'isolation', 'infected', 'died', 'inability', 'virus', 'worst', 'toll', 'inequalities', 'tragic', 'suicide', 'damaging', 'death', 'death', 'worse', 'assault', 'resistance', 'isolation', 'issue', 'warning', 'strict', 'outbreak', 'ailing', 'outbreak', 'denied', 'struggling', 'outbreak', 'doom', 'loss', 'waste', 'losses', 'lost', 'jobless', 'impose', 'emergency', 'hardships', 'rail', 'virus', 'died', 'virus', 'impose', 'cash-strapped', 'isolate', 'infected', 'drastic', 'isolation', 'isolation', 'panic', 'outbreak', 'illegal', 'falsely', 'misleading', 'misleading', 'grim', 'outbreak', 'virus', 'contagious', 'virus', 'virus', 'struggling', 'infection', 'delay', 'uncontrolled', 'symptoms', 'lukewarm', 'adverse', 'virus', 'virus', 'needy', 'virus', 'outbreak', 'isolated', 'virus']"
838,JODHPUR,[],2 students commit suicide in separate incidents in Jodhpur,"JODHPUR: Unable to deal with emotional stress, two students committed suicide on Thursday night in two separate incidents. Of the two, one was on the verge of stepping into higher education while the other had a promising career in medicine before her. In one of these incidents, a first year student of AIIMS, Jodhpur, Rashmi Yadav (20) hung herself from the ceiling of her hostel room barely four days after her admission in the institution. SHO (Shastri Nagar) Amit Sihag said Yadav was a resident of Alwar and had been admitted in AIIMS, Jodhpur as a student of MBBS. She had been accommodated in the hostel. “On Thursday night at about 10.30pm, we received information that a girl had committed suicide in her hostel room. She was not seen around after 8.00pm. When the other students came to call her for dinner, door of her room was found latched from inside,” said the officer. The staff was called in and the door of her room was broken after receiving no response from inside. Rashmi was found hanging from the ceiling fan. She was rushed to the emergency of the hospital where she was declared dead. Doctors tried to restore her by giving CPR but she did not respond. In a note left behind by Rashmi, she has mentioned some sir advising him to be kind with the students. She had also apologized to her parents for taking this extreme step. Sihag said that a report has been given by her parents seeking investigation into the suicide terming it to be suspicious. They also believed that she was subjected to some ill-treatment by some teacher in the institute claiming that she was happy while taking admission in the institution. The director of the AIIMS was tried to be contacted repeatedly but he did not return the call. This was the third suicide case by the AIIMS student in past 3 years. In the other incident, a 12th class student of Chopasni School, Hardayal Singh (17) hung himself from the pipe of the toilet of his hostel in school campus on Thursday night. According to the police, his mother had passed away in December and he was in depression since then. He also mentioned this in his suicide note, which was found in his hostel room. He belonged to Pokran in Jaisalmer district and had been studying in this school for the past three years.

The deceased — identified as Ganesh Shankarrao Kopurwad, hailing from Majalgaon in Beed district — has left a suicide note blaming his former girlfriend for his action. The suicide was second in last two weeks in the same hostel and in both cases the police have found broken relationships as the reason behind the extreme step. In the earlier case, 23-year-old Amol Kakde from Kakde Andhari of Jalna district ended his life by hanging himself in his hostel room. In the latest incident, the Begumpura police said that Ganesh had confirmed his admission in the first year of computer science just two days ago and was living in the room of his brother, Umesh, who is also a student at the varsity. Umesh left for attending his classes alone after Ganesh expressed unwillingness to go to his department at 11am. When he returned at 1 pm, the room was closed from inside and upon knocking there was no response. “When he peeped inside the room, he was shocked to see Ganesh hanging from the ceiling. He raised an alarm and broke the door. Ganesh was rushed to the Government Medical College and Hospital where he was declared dead on arrival,” said a police officer. Police sub-inspector Rahul Rode reached the spot with his squad and seized the suicide note written in Marathi with pencil. “As of today, a case of accidental death has been registered that may be converted into a criminal case. He has blamed his former girlfriend for his suicide and accused her of torturing her for the last one year,” he said.

840,"The news of the suicide of 34-year-old Hindi film actor Sushant Singh Rajput may have brought back memories of southern star Silk Smitha who was found hanging at her home 24 years ago. She was among those who reached a peak in their career but were pushed over the edge. While the deaths may be from different eras, it raises the question whether a life under the arclights, straddling fame and ambition, makes it more difficult to cope with the pitfalls that come with the highs. In the 1980s, young actors Shobha, Fatafat Jayalaxmi, ‘Kozhi Koovuthu’ Viji all achieved stardom in the southern film industry but faced similar endings due to unspoken troubles haunting them for months.

Psychologist Abilasha S says reaching the pinnacle is simple but maintaining and managing successes and failures are tougher for celebrities. “A small disturbance can have a bigger impact.” A life under scrutiny, with failures magnified and every decision over analysed tends to make people sensitive and insecure that could result in trust issues. “Making quality friends is arduous with a lot of teasing and bullying within the industry. The hectic workstyle affects normal lifestyle and people tend to lose control,” says Abilasha, who believes lack of a strong emotional support system and compromise on privacy of personal lives have long-lasting repercussions. With no proper friend circle, some go on a downward spiral involved in unwanted relationships and even drug abuse. The stigma surrounding mental health has made it further difficult for those who are affected by it. Despite the awareness in recent times, not many talk about problems.

Working on projects back-to-back, the heady taste of success, the need to stay in the race, is a reason for burnout for some people, for others, the stress could show when offers dry up.

Actor Kasthuri Shankar points out that mental health issues affect people from different backgrounds and stresses on the importance of finding a way to cope. “There are more suicides among Class X students when compared to the film industry but incidents in tinsel town get more attention. Kollywood personalities are an intelligent lot for they look for options when they face a lull in their professional life.

841,Nagpur,[],"Covid killed 18, suicides claimed over 140 in lockdown","Nagpur: While all of us are talking about Covid-19 deaths, suicides have killed many more people than the novel coronavirus during lockdown. At least 140 suicides have been reported from Nagpur district (city and rural) over the last 87 days. Covid deaths, on the other hand, are 18 — with at least four of the deceased hailing from other cities or states. Alarmingly, suicide cases had gone down significantly during March and April, when the first and second phase of lockdown were imposed. But, more incidents have been reported in the month of May, with a sudden spike in June. Anti-Suicide Campaign Nagpur — a social awareness group in city run by activist Rahul Motwani — is into counselling of those who have suicidal feelings. The group keeps a record of suicide cases. According to Motwani, more than 140 people, including housewives, students, employed, businessmen, and migrants, have committed suicide from March 24 onwards, and most of them are below 45 years of age. “We keep track of suicide news published in newspapers daily. But, as per my experience, many suicides go unreported. Many are attempted suicides, which find no place in newspapers. If we consider all these, the number will be much more than 140,” said Motwani. Since 2013, his NGO runs a suicide prevention helpline. In 2017, they launched a Facebook page ‘Anti-Suicide Campaign Nagpur’. “Many call me on our helpline numbers and nowadays we get messages on Facebook page too. I try to counsel on call these days as personal visits are not possible due to Covid distancing and lockdown,” said Motwani. There is no separate record of suicides available with the police. Suicides, electrocutions, drownings, deaths due to falls etc are registered under the head of ‘accidental death’. But police records also show similar trend. Psychiatrist and psychotherapist Dr Nikhil Pande said that many of his patients are coming back to him for counselling during lockdown. “Depression is the major reason behind suicides. Job or business loss due to lockdown has added immense stress for working population. That is why we see a major number of working and earning population committing suicides,” he said. Reasons behind suicides vary from financial loss to failed family relations, stressful life, loneliness, demand for money from in-laws to inability to cope with lockdown losses and so on. But, not a single suicide has been recorded in Nagpur due to Covid-19 threat, or Covid-19 stigma. In fact, Vidarbha’s only Covid-19 suicide was reported from Akola, where a 30-yr-old labourer from Assam slit his throat in the bathroom of Covid isolation ward on the day he was detected positive. The Indian Psychiatry Society (IPS) study showed a 20% rise in mental illness cases during lockdown, affecting at least one in five Indians. This study claims that people have been living in fear of losing their jobs, and businesses due to the lockdown resulting in mental distress. The same study also predicted that a post-Covid-19 landscape will be a fertile breeding ground for an increase in chronic stress, anxiety, depression, alcohol dependence, and self-harm.

Brother found Mirza hanging in his room with a nylon rope at 7.30pm on Monday. Police recovered a suicide note written by Mirza stating ‘harassment from college’. “We found the suicide note in his room. He failed in an exam, after which the college authorities have been harassing him to pay exam fees. We are checking if it led to his suicide,” Madannapet inspector D Nagesh said. However, the college management has denied harassing him over exam fees. Cops are yet to question the college officials. “We will see if harassment and negligence on the part of the college has any role in Mirza’s suicide,” he said. Mirza, a fourth year student, did not go to the college on Monday. In the afternoon, he locked the room from inside and his family thought he was taking rest. “Around 7.30pm, Mirza’s brother broke the door and saw him hanging,” said Nagesh. P Karunakar, principal, said Mirza had been lying low for the last several weeks and was being counselled by staff members. “He did not appear for one of his exams and failed in a theory exam. He was trying hard to cope up with studies and we had given him good marks in the practicals. But, he had been seen distraught in the last few weeks,” said Karunakar. He said there is a huge gap of eight years between Mirza’s bachelor degree in dental surgery and masters. “We tried to help him in every possible way and counselled him. He was depressed due to academics. I have no idea why he has mentioned the college in his suicide note,” he said.

844,KOTTAYAM,[],Student’s suicide: Father accuses school of torture,"KOTTAYAM: Father of a student who committed suicide two days ago has alleged that his son took the extreme step after he was subjected to mental torture by school authorities. Speaking to reporters here on Monday, Eapen Varghese said the authorities at the Crossroads School in Pampady, where his son Binto had been studying, had told him to transfer the boy to another school after he failed in two papers in the second-term examination of Class IX. They said they cannot promote him to the next class and took back Class X text books, which were earlier given to him, Varghese said. The student was depressed and the traumatic experience forced him to consider suicide, Varghese added. However, the school principal refuted the allegations. “We did not ask the student to leave the school and we did not issue a TC. He was weak in studies and after the model exams, we alerted his parents, which we usually do,” said the principal. Police have registered a case of unnatural death and have begun investigation. “We are looking at all possible angles. We are waiting for the autopsy report,” said Mahesh Kumar, Pallickathode SI. Fourteen-year-old Binto was found hanging in his house on Saturday evening. It has been alleged that the school authorities had asked several other students as well to leave the school after they fared badly in the Class IX exam so that the school could secure a 100% pass rate in the Class X exams. The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has sought a report from the police. It will also conduct an inquiry whether more students were asked to leave the school. A protest march to the school, organized by SFI activists on Sunday, had turned violent. The protesters ransacked the school and its properties. Police registered case against 200 individuals in connection with the incident.  The Youth Congress had organized a rally to the residence of the school principal.

Ekisha, a student of Ahlcon Public School, Mayur Vihar, lived with her parents and elder brother in Noida Sector 52. She hanged herself from a grill of her house when the family members were away. She was rushed to Kailash Hospital where doctors declared her brought dead. The victim’s family alleged that Ekisha took the extreme step after she was sexually harassed and purposefully failed in science and social science exams. Police initially registered a case of abetment to suicide and criminal intimidation against the school’s social science teacher Rajiv Sehgal, science teacher Neeraj Anand and principal Dharmendra Goyal. However, later Section 354 (outraging woman’s modesty) of IPC and POCSO Act were also added to the FIR. Sah alleged that the police may be under pressure from the school management and hence no arrest has been made so far. Ekisha’s mother Deepmala Nutan said that this fight for justice was not only for Ekisha. “We are trying to ensure no other student meets such an end,” she said. The school management has denied the allegations, saying the school has been following promotion policies of CBSE. The management said the student’s parents had not made any complaint regarding harassment in the past. Arun Kumar Singh, SP (city) Noida said that the police have not found any evidence to corroborate the allegations of sexual harassment levelled in the FIR. “We had requested the CBSE to form a board for a re-evaluation of the student’s answer-sheets. They have issued a letter and formed the board. We are now seeking permission from the court for a date for re-evaluation,” he said.

848,T’puram,[],Suicide attempt by Class X student: Probe launched,"T’puram: The Kollam police have launched a probe into the alleged suicide attempt by a class X girl after her parents raised allegations pertaining to harassment from her teachers. The girl had allegedly jumped off from the third floor of the school, Trinity Lyceum under Kollam West police station limits, on Friday afternoon. The police registered a case after recording the statement of her father, visiting him at a private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram, where she is under treatment. Kollam West SI A Nisamudheen said that a case was registered against teachers Sindhu and Crescent on charges of abetment of suicide. The father of the girl had alleged that it was the harassment and ill-treatment meted out to the girl that prompted her to take this extreme step. According to the girl’s father, it was the disciplinary action taken out by one of the teachers on his younger daughter, a Class VIII student of the same school, that culminated into the suicide attempt by the elder one. As a punishment for talking during the class, the teacher made her sit among boys. The parents were later informed about the incident, who met the teachers and promised that there would not be any such conduct from their daughter in the future. However, she repeated the offence following which the teacher punished her again the same way. This also resulted in her friends ridiculing her in public. She complained about this to her elder sister, who picked up a quarrel with the other students. The teachers came to know about the incident and they summoned her to the staff room and reprimanded her. It was after this, she allegedly jumped off from the third floor of the school building. SI Nisamudheen said that the girl’s condition remains critical. tnn ",22-10-2017,"['suicide', 'allegations', 'harassment', 'limits', 'suicide', 'harassment', 'ill-treatment', 'suicide', 'offence', 'complained', 'quarrel', 'critical']"

Flanked by the father of the eight-year-old boy who was allegedly killed by a senior student in a Gurgaon school, Raghav Sah said he would start a nation-wide movement to “save the daughters of India.” “Nearly 30,000 people from Bihar will come to Delhi for a protest,” he said. “If required, we will go to the PMO or India Gate,” he added. On being asked why he was not approaching a local court, he said it was a national case. “My daughter has left the world and she has been sexually harassed and you are saying it was not a national case,” he said. While police have sought evidence from the family to support allegations of sexual harassment, he refused to share any with police. “We will provide evidence in the court and not to police. If I have to give evidence, should I give to police or in court,” he asked. Claiming that Ekisha had complained about the alleged molestation by the social studies teacher in November and December, he said he initially told her daughter that the teacher might be trying to “encourage her.” “She said that he would not look at her but would try to come near her on finding her alone. She would say that he would repeat “you are a failure” and that “you are dumb”,” he told mediapersons during a press conference at his home in Sector 52. He alleged that once when she was having periods, she was denied a sanitary napkin by the school and was slapped at least eight-ten times by a teacher for coming late to the class from the washroom. “She went to the bathroom and took almost 15-20 minutes to return. But the teacher got angry and Ekisha was made to stand on a bench for half-an-hour by that teacher in front of her classmates. She came back crying. There is no humanity in the school,” he alleged.

He said he empathises with the family and would consult his lawyers to decide on further action. The boy was a student of Class II in a well-known CBSE school in Gurgaon’s Bhondsi. He died after his throat was slit by a sharp-edged weapon on the morning of September 8, 2017 on the school premises. The boy’s father said he could understand the pain and suffering of the Sahs who have lost an innocent child. “I support the family’s demand for a CBI probe into the matter. The role of the accused teachers should be probed,” he said. In the Gurgaon case, police first arrested Ashok Kumar, a 42-year-old bus conductor, for his murder. However, on November 8, CBI apprehended a Class XI student of the same school in connection with murder. The juvenile accused, believed to be weak in his studies, allegedly killed the boy to force school management to declare holiday in order to defer a scheduled parent-teacher meeting (PTM) and an examination. The boy’s father said, Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had set up a fact-finding committee to probe his son’s case. “The committee found that there were severe irregularities and security lapses in school premises.

863,MUMBAI,[],CBI told to pay Rs 15 lakh for shoddy ‘murder’ probe,"MUMBAI: The Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission (MSHRC) has directed the CBI director to pay Rs 15 lakh to the father of an MBA student for carrying out a shoddy probe into his mysterious death thus delaying delivery of justice. The commission said the father has been waiting for justice for seven years and the adverse findings against the CBI by a magistrate court raises question over the credibility of the investigators and the way they function. The commission’s directions came in response to a complaint filed by Vijay Singh, a Patna resident whose son Santosh was found dead under mysterious circumstances in Kharghar on July 15, 2011. The commission said the compensation has to be paid for violation of his fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution within six weeks and disciplinary action initiated against the erring officers. MSHRC member M A Sayeed, in his order, asked the CBI to sensitise officers about significance of a proper investigation in accordance with the rules and procedures. Vijay Singh had filed a complaint with the commission in 2011, which was amended five years later with additional evidence. The CBI, which last probed the murder case based on a high court order, had concluded it as a suicide and filed a closure report in the magistrate court at Panvel. The magistrate court refused to accept the report pointing out lapses and ordered arrest of the accused for murder. Santosh stayed on the fourth floor of Janardan Sadan building with three friends—Vikas Kumar, Jitendra Kumar, Dheeraj Kumar. On July 15, 2011, he was found dead in the balcony of a first floor flat. Kharghar police registered an accidental death report on the basis of Jitendra’s statement where he mentioned that Santosh had, under the influence of alcohol, committed suicide by jumping from the toilet window. Vijay was not satisfied with the finding of the local police that Santosh committed suicide. In 2012, he filed a writ petition in the high court, which ordered a CID probe, but Vijay was again not satisfied with the progress. On his request, the high court then ordered a CBI probe. The CBI registered a case of murder and filed a closure report in a Panvel court. Magistrate J M Chavan, in his December 2017 order rejecting the closure report, said the possibility of Santosh being under the influence of alcohol is not proved in the chemical analysis report. “It is impossible for the deceased to climb atop the flush tank under the influence of alcohol and remove the window panes.” The magistrate also cited various other inconsistencies based on the medical report, including the time of the death. “Material showed that the investigation was not proper, and it was done in a manner to save the accused,” the court said. The court believed that the deceased was inflicted multiple injuries with a sharp object due to which he died. The court observed that evidence showed the accused had killed Santosh and thrown the body down to show it as a suicide.

864,KANPUR/GREATER NOIDA,['21-year-old'],Engineering student ends life after 'harassment' by Greater Noida institute,"KANPUR/GREATER NOIDA: Parents of a 21-year-old engineering student who allegedly committed suicide at home in Etawah on Thursday night have claimed he was constantly harassed by senior students at his Greater Noida institute. Mahendra Pratap Singh was a first-year student of computer science engineering at Galgotia's College of Engineering and Technology in Greater Noida. According to the university, he had not been allowed to appear for secondterm examinations as he had not attended classes since January . Etawah SP (crime) Jitendra Srivastava said an investigation into the student's death is under way. “We have not yet received any complaint that the boy took the extreme step owing to harsh behaviour of his seniors at the institute. We are treating it as a case of suicide. No suicide note has been recovered. If his parents complain against students or faculty , we will initiate investigation,“ he said. Mahendra went to sleep in his mother's room on Thursday night, but around midnight, went to his room where he apparently hanged himself from the ceiling fan. “We had got him admitted to Galgotia's College of Engineering and Technology in 2016. He had come home for Dussehra. Our child had called us several times and told us the atmosphere of college was not conducive and he could not stay there any more. On a few occasions, we had to send our elder son to bring him home,“ said his mother Sadhna Singh. His father Awadh Pratap Singh, a subedar in the Army , and a resident of Vijaynagar in Etawah, told TOI, “He always complained to us that his seniors used to rag and make fun of him.“ However, Galgotias University denied the allegations of harassment made by Mahendra's parents, pointing out that the student was not a hosteller so it could not be a case of ragging. The university said he had not attended classes from January 2017. It claimed that Mahendra had low attendance (44%) and was debarred from appearing in second-semester exams. “He has not turned up for the classes since January 2017 and was debarred from second-term exams. We organise examinations for debarred students in August, but the student did not fill up the form for the same. The university never received any complaint from the student,“ vice-chancellor Renu Luthra told TOI.

The teacher being a Nepal citizen, the Nepalese embassy has been informed. When a TOI team tried to enter the Sakya Academy on Sunday, they were stopped saying the entry of media persons and outsiders had been prohibited at the school. “From his suicide note, we believe he hanged himself out of guilt. He has also recorded a voice note on his mobile phone, which is in his native tongue and we are in the process of translating. Currently, it seems we can expect no major revelations from it apart from what we already know,” said Rakesh Shah, in-charge of the Rajpur Police Station. Police are also verifying the students’ claims, who said in a video that they were beaten up when they wanted to go home for the festive season. Between October 27 and 28, seven Nepal-origin students had fled the school by taking a cab to Banbasa. While four managed to reach home in India and Nepal, three were stopped at Banbasa check point and brought back to school. The deceased teacher was one of the teachers who went to Banbasa to bring back the trio. Sources told TOI that soon after returning with the escaped students on Saturday, the teacher, who taught Buddhist Studies, shut himself in his room and subsequently hanged himself. In a suicide note and a voice recording that he left behind, the teacher said he had been feeling responsible for the allegations of physical abuse levelled against his senior colleague by the students. He also confessed to have kept a mobile phone with him against the rules of the school. Police are investigating whether the pictures and videos of the escaped students had gone viral from the teacher's phone. To recall, the pictures and videos of the students, some showing bruises on their bodies and accusing their teacher of assault, had gone viral last week. The matter had also caught the attention of the state child rights panel, which had demanded a probe. Lokjeet Singh, SP (crime), Dehradun who is handling the case, told TOI, “We have registered the statement of the in-house students. The three students, who were brought back have not complained of any major physical abuse. The allegations of violence have been levelled by some other students who didn’t flee and we are ascertaining if such a crime took place or not.” He added that the teacher who has been accused of thrashing the students can’t be interrogated at present as he has tested Covid-19-positive and is presently undergoing treatment.

868,BHOPAL,[],Think-tank report on suicide a wake-up call,"BHOPAL: A surge in cases of suicide in the state and across the country points to somewhat a disturbing fact. All is not well with mental health of citizens, particularly youth. A report by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Good Governance and Policy Analysis, a Bhopal-based think tank, in a way, indicate a swift action before it gets too late. The report— ‘suicide prevention strategy framework for Madhya Pradesh’— “MP with a population of over 7 crore has just 15 psychiatric doctors in government hospitals, as opposed to 700 mandated in the National Health Mission (NHM).” Experts also strongly feel there is an urgent need to put in place a good health infrastructure in the state sooner than later. “Madhya Pradesh with a population of over 7 crore has just 15 psychiatric doctors in government hospitals, as opposed to 700 as mandated in NHM,” says the report. In Madhya Pradesh, 6-7% — around 42 lakh people suffer from mental health problems and 1-2% — 14 lakh have severe disorder, says the report. The report argues there is no comprehensive suicide prevention framework in place in the state. The report that takes into account causes and demography of suicides in Bhopal in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 10 months of 2016, studies and covers data from 34 police stations in the state capital. “Suicide is one of the three leading causes of death in economically productive age group (15-44 years) and second major cause in 15-19 years,” reads the report. It highlights youth in the age group of 20-30 years are most vulnerable category. Men are more vulnerable than women. “Youth in age group of 10-40 years comprise 60% of total suicide cases. Private job holders, housewives, labourers and students form the high-risk category. Family and mental problems, diseases and financial problems were major causes of suicide,” the report states. The study shows there is a consistent increase in number of suicides among men, a trend in keeping with the global phenomenon. Demographic profile of victims also indicates there is a strong tendency among youth to commit suicide. “Except for Indore medical colleges, no other government-run medical institute has introduced PG course in clinical psychiatry in the state. There are no courses for clinical psychology in any medical colleges of state,” reads the report. There is no helpline for suicide prevention in MP, the report points out. At present, MP has two psychiatric hospitals — Mansik Arogyasala and psychiatric hospital in Indore. On Saturday, Union minister Thawar Chand Gehlot announced a psychiatric rehabilitation centre with ‘world-class’ facilities would be set up soon in Bhopal. The study also lists a framework for suicide prevention in Madhya Pradesh based on findings. The approach adopted follows three phases— identification, intervention and mainstreaming. The major steps talk about identifying triggers for suicide. “Research across the world suggests existence certain risk factors or pre-disposition, which might precipitate into a crisis,” reads the report. The causative factors can be individual (mental disorder, substance abuse), socio-cultural (stigma associated with talking about problems) or situational (failure in exams, financial problems). This apart, the target group needs to be identified for intervention. Mainstreaming revolves around removal of stigma. Dr Satyakant Trivedi, a psychiatrist, who is spearheading a campaign to include mental health in school curriculum, says, “Suicides can be prevented if a stigma around mental health is removed. Mental health facilities in India and the state need a lot of improvement. The facilities should be made accessible to all strata of the society.” ",08-03-2018,"['suicide', 'disturbing', 'tank', 'suicide', 'urgent', 'suffer', 'problems', 'severe', 'disorder', 'suicide', 'death', 'vulnerable', 'vulnerable', 'suicide', 'problems', 'problems', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'risk', 'precipitate', 'crisis', 'disorder', 'abuse', 'stigma', 'problems', 'failure', 'problems', 'stigma', 'stigma']"

We have also recovered a suicide note from his room where he apologizes to his mother and has written that he is not in relationship with any girl.” “We asked the family members but no one claimed to know why he clarified about not being in a relationship. They told us that he was depressed about something but refused to share anything when asked,” he added. This is the third such case in the city.

The police have registered an accidental death case after a complaint was lodged by the Gavali’s friend, Kajol Desai (20), who stays in the building.  Gavali, a resident of Ghatkopar, seems to have ended her life over a failed affair with a first-year student of the institute, the police said. However, the cops have not yet found a suicide note. “The victim had come to stay with her college friends at the rental third floor flat in the building. She used to frequently stay away from home,” said inspector Sunil Darekar.  “She had attempted suicide in December 2015 by slitting her wrist with a blade,” he added. Around 7 pm, Gavali went to the refuge area on the seventh floor and jumped off. “One hour before the incident, Gavali had sent a text to her friend, saying ‘dreams are as bad as death now’, which shows that she was depressed,” said Darekar.

883,MUMBAI,[],Mumbai: Three doctors in Payal Tadvi case join PG at Nair hospital with police escort as deceased’s mom protests,"MUMBAI: Gynaecology students Dr Hema Ahuja, Dr Bhakti Mehare and Dr Ankita Khandelwal joined their college BYL Nair Hospital on Monday with police protection. The doctors, accused of abetting the suicide of Dr Payal Tadvi, were escorted by police vehicles, even as Dr Tadvi’s mother Abeda and members of Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi staged a protest outside the institute in Mumbai Central. Teachers from the department refused to comment on the case. Dean Dr Ramesh Bharmal confirmed that the three doctors had joined college to resume their third year of PG education. “They will be posted in Covid work like every other resident doctor,” he said, refusing to comment further. The Supreme Court had on October 8 allowed them to resume studies, saying they are entitled to all their fundamental rights as they are presumably innocent until proven guilty. The doctors had done two of three years of their PG degree in gynaecology and obstetrics before Dr Tadvi’s suicide in May last year. Most resident doctors at Nair Hospital that TOI spoke to did not wish to comment on the case. “Almost a year and half has passed since the incident during which we have all been busy fighting a pandemic,” said a resident. Another doctor said, “It’s a Supreme Court order. What more can one say?” A third doctor said that Monday’s power outage kept everyone busy. Abeda, who was a part of the protest, with Forum Against Oppression of Women, questioned what action was taken on the basis of the antiragging panel’s report. She also wrote to CM Uddhav Thackeray, iterating how the panel’s recommendations were not followed. Abeda said grave injustice has been done to the family by allowing the women to return to college and urged the state to file a review petition against the apex court order. She said college and hospital had around 250 witnesses cited in the case, including those who are key to the prosecution’s case.

Police said the 17-year-old girl left behind a suicide note, claiming she was ‘disturbed over constant stalking and eve-teasing’ and thus took the extreme step. “My family has no fault in this. I cannot take teasing any more so killing myself,” a police officer said quoting from the hand-written suicide note. According to the note, someone had been stalking her for the past many days and passing lewd remarks. And she was upset over the repeated harassment on the streets, the cop added. However, family members of the girl said they were not aware of the problem as she had never told them anything like this. The girl, who used to study in a private school near her village, hanged herself with a dupatta from a ceiling fan in her room on Sunday night. On Monday morning, when she did not come out of her room till 8am, her parents went to call her. But her room’s door was locked from inside. After repeated attempts when she did not open the door, the family members broke open the door and found her body hanging. Later, a team from Badshapur police station went to the house and found a suicide note in her room. On the basis of the note, police have initiated a case of abatement to suicide against an unknown person under Section 306 of the IPC. “The girl in her suicide note said she was disturbed over regular stalking and eve-teasing. But, she did not mention the name of the accused. Our team is on the job and the accused will be arrested soon,” said Ashok Bakshi, DCP (south). Police sources said they were trying to talk to her friends and local people to find out the stalker.

According to the Anandapuram police, the deceased, identified as Yarnagula Karthik was a resident of Parlakhemundi in Gajapati district in Odisha. He had completed his schooling in Odisha and joined an intermediate course in Vizag. While it is still unclear as to what prompted the 16-year-old to take his own life, questions have arose with regard to whether the incident was recorded in the CCTV camera and what the security personnel were doing at the time. There are also suspicions of foul play. Upon finding the student battling for life, the college management reportedly admitted him at a private hospital in Vizag. Karthik breathed his last while undergoing treatment. On receiving information about the incident, the cops rushed to the spot. The police have spoken to his roommates and students close to him.

886,PATIALA,[],"PhD scholar alleges caste bias, threatens suicide","PATIALA: High drama was witnessed outside the office of Punjabi University vice-chancellor when a PhD student threatened to commit suicide alleging mental torture from the last three years by university professors of the physics department. Upset over losing three academic years despite being selected as a research scholar, Kulwinder Kaur also threatened to commit suicide in front of the V-C office. She alleged caste discrimination against her as she belonged to Scheduled Caste category. Following this, the dean girls hostel immediately called the entire physics faculty to inquire into the matter. A meeting was held with the student where faculty members, including her guide, tried to convince the girl to calm down and rationally discuss the issue with them. The scholar claimed that three years ago a professor in the physics department had said that she would not let her complete her research. “Three years ago, I got admission in the university to do PhD in Physics but the professor did not want me here as she was annoyed with me over some issue. I uploaded my story on Facebook following which the professor lodged a case of defamation against me and I had to apologise to her as part of compromise in the police station. My father and I pleaded with a number of professors to help me in my research, but in vain. Now after two years my guide was changed in April last and Dr Jaspal Singh became my guide, but it looks like he too is under the influence of other professors. I am being asked to go to private Thapar University or any other private lab to conduct the study as part of my research work. My attendance is not being marked in the university,” Kulwinder alleged. Meanwhile, assistant professor Jaspal Singh has denied all allegations. “I had helped the scholar in every way and at times I also went out of the way to help her with her research. She does not come to the university and her attendance almost nil. Next month her seminar will be conducted and she does not want to appear there. This is the reason why she is levelling false allegation against us. There is no caste discrimination at all as there are other professors in our department who belong to the SC community and have passed out from here.” The scholar however later met the VC Professor BS Ghuman who assured her for every help including the financial help.

The girl had alleged that she was gang-raped three months ago by four men wearing battle fatigues. The family members of the girl had pointed fingers at the government for not arresting the culprits involved in the case. Members of NSUI, a student wing of the Congress, staged dharna near the gate protesting the lackadaisical attitude of the state government in addressing the issue. They demanded resignation of chief minister Naveen Patnaik for the incident. Students of Utkal University also joined the group and blocked Acharya Vihar-Vani Vihar Road for around half an hour by burning tyres on the road. They demanded formation of special investigation team (SIT) under the direct supervision of Orissa high court to probe the Kunduli rape case. “She was denied justice. It is a shame for the state government. If a chief minister cannot give justice to the schoolgirl, why he will continue in his office?” asked Manoj Kumar Biswal. Later ABVP, a student wing affiliated to RSS, staged silent protest at the gate by wearing black badges. They also demanded resignation of chief minister for not helping the girl. “The state government claims that it respects women, but the Kunduli case exposed its real character. Is it the respect for women agenda of ‘Ideal chief minister’? We will intensify our stir if the state government fails to give justice to the girl,” said Priyanka Mallik, ABVP’s state women wing chief. President of ruling BJD’s student wing Rana Pratap Patra said the suicide case should not be politicised. “The state government will give justice to the Kunduli girl.

888,AHMEDABAD,[],Forensic experts discuss tough cases,"AHMEDABAD: Puzzling suicide cases to unusual murders and cyber crimes to terrorist attacks, forensic scientists in the country face all sorts of challenges on a daily basis. At the 24th All India Forensic Science Conference in Ahmedabad, experts spoke about some tough ones. When DNA nailed a serial rapist: A case handled by FSL, MP, had a DNA sample from the scene of the rape of a minor victim. The sample matched with two previous cases of rape in the state where the victims were minors. The cops managed to nab the accused who changed his identity and address frequently as cases of sexual assault came to light. Negative fingerprint, positive result: A team from Central FSL of CBI probing the Vyapam scam of Madhya Pradesh were searching for thumbprints on an OMR sheet that had come for forensic analysis. The thumb prints were not properly recorded intentionally, and excess pressure was applied. The experts managed to develop a negative fingerprint from one of the papers and enhance it. The method found an identical match to one of the suspects. Firing standard bullets from country-made firearms: In a case handled by the Central FSL of the CBI, experts came across a case where the accused had changed the calibre of a .315” rifle to .30-06”. Due to the difference, crimes committed by the country-made firearm would send police searching for a licensed firearm. A nexus of engineers, machine operators and gun shop owners was busted. Flames don’t lie: A photograph was presented to experts at FSL Kolkata for examination where an insurance claim due to fire was presented. When the experts minutely studied the photograph of a fire in gunnysacks containing potatoes, they found the use of the stamping technique of photo editing, with similar patches of the same set of flames at four different parts of the photograph, which is not possible under natural circumstances. Future course of the discipline discussed On the last day of the conference, a group discussion titled ‘Bridging the gap between academia and forensic field practitioners - Way Forward’ took place, where GU V-C Prof Himanshu Pandya and the organizing secretary of conference K V Ravi Kumar participated with other experts. Organizers said the panelists advocated for the formation of a forensic council, to look after affairs of forensic science education and implement a uniform syllabus across the country. They also advocated quality checks and opportunities for students in the private sector. The experts also suggested reservations for forensic experts in police recruitment. One suggestion was to create a national research repository so that there is no duplication of projects.

Addressing the student gathering, the minister promised to fulfil their requirements and extend basic facilities and infrastructure to the college within two months. “I have brought it to the government’s notice that the college is short of basic facilities. The government had plans to shift the college to the outskirts of the city. But when the CM visited the college a week ago, students requested him to drop the plan. Now we are thinking of constructing a new college next to Nanjaraja Bahadur Choultry,” he added. The minister who had on a previous occasion reeled out a rather unusual tip for students — one should not pick a partner based on looks—had another one today. On marriage and divorce. He expressed his concern at the rise in divorce cases among today’s young generation. “Youngsters end up getting divorced even after marrying the person they love. In life one must have faith in each other and stick with their spouse and fight the odds,” he advised students. Reminiscing his days of struggle, Devegowda said that suicide is not the solution for the problems that befall us. “I contesting against Srikantadatta Naramsimharaja Wadiyar, and lost. I sold my house and I am here still, ”GT Devegowda said. New rule Devegowda on Monday said the government will soon stop appointing non-academics to the university syndicate as its members. “There are allegations that non-academic members are allegedly disrupting the affairs of the syndicate and some have become members of the Local Inspection Committee and are intervening in academic affairs. Their inexperience may weaken the body which has powers to take important decisions,” he minister said. According to the Universities Act, the government has powers to appoint six members from among educationists but non-academicians are appointed.

A CCTV footage showed he was kneeling down on the track when a train ran over him. Though police are investigating the case from all possible angles, friends of the deceased confirmed that he was involved in the Blue Whale challenge. Satvik Pandey, a student of Navjagrati school in Damoh, committed suicide at around 11pm on Saturday. A CCTV camera of a house near the track recorded the visuals of the boy. The visuals showed the boy was first standing near the tracks and then sitting down on his knees moments before the train was seen in the camera’s frame. In the next frame, the train was seen hitting the boy. The police came to know about the incident at around 2am. Prakash Dube, maternal uncle of Satvik, said he had left home at around 9 on his bike. Father of the student is a clerk in a government department and mother is a school teacher. Satvik was their only son. Dube said that the family learnt about the tragedy after the police called them in the early hours on Sunday. Satvik’s family did not have any clue whether the boy was involved in the game or not.

891,GURUGRAM,['17-year-old'],Father of Class 12 boy who jumped to death blames girl’s online post,"GURUGRAM: As #BoisLocker-Room unravelled, a 17-year-old girl shared on Instagram this Monday an alleged incident from two years ago. It involved a classmate who had allegedly asked her to perform a sexual act on him in the basement of her housing society. The boy, a Class XII student, was trolled as the girl’s post got shared. The same night, he jumped to death from his 11th-floor flat in a DLF 5 condominium. On Thursday, the boy’s father approached police with a complaint in which he blamed online harassment and trolling for his son’s suicide, sought legal changes in the use of social media by teens, and asked a question: can social media disclosures without the burden of proof be allowed? ‘Boy trolled, shamed before suicide’He wasn’t that kind of a person. You can talk to anyone in his friends’ circle and in his school,” the boy’s father told TOI, referring to the allegations against him. The trolls have now turned on the girl (A in subsequent references), from hailing her bravery three days ago to blaming her for the boy’s death. To cut herself off, she said she has had to deactivate her account, but isn’t going back on what she wrote. “I deactivated my account because of the filth that I was being subjected to after his death. It’s sad he took this step. But, that doesn’t prove my story wrong,” she told TOI. The postOn Monday morning, #BoisLockerRoom dominated conversations online and offline, but among high school students, it was more than that. It was relatable. A and some of her close friends found themselves revealing personal experiences to each other, about objectification, casual sexual aggression and vulgarity that get regularly subjected to, and the ‘normalisation’ of it that angered them. “I told them about my experience. Everyone was shocked. They told me I should no longer be silent and that the story needs to be out there. In that moment, I decided to stand up for myself and tell my story. I knew I’ll be trolled but I wanted to say it,” said A. She put up the post late on Monday, around 10pm. Soon, some of her friends took screenshots and started reposted it, tagging the boy (B from here on). The trolling began immediately. Friends of B told TOI he was shamed, bullied and threatened. “He even pleaded with one of the girl’s friends, who had reposted the story, to take it down and that it was not true. He wanted her to understand his side of the story. But they were relentless. When several people started abusing him online, he panicked. He reached out to us and was sobbing,” said a classmate and close friend of B. “He was always busy with his football, dog, and family. He fell victim to mob justice over baseless allegations,” she added. A said she mentioned the boy’s name but did not tag him. But her friends were angry and began tagging him in their reposts. This led to others being able to identify his account. They were both in Class X when, according to A, B wanted to come and meet her, just a few days after they had become friend. After reaching the A’s society, B allegedly proposed a walk in the basement. There, she claims, he touched her inappropriately. “I was alarmed and pushed him away. I tried running away but he held me and pulled me. He then started demanding sexual favours. I pushed him with greater force and ran upstairs. He came up and told me he had forgotten his wallet in the basement and I should accompany him to find it. I refused and went home. I blocked him everywhere after that,” A said. “I was tired of keeping it inside me. I don’t have proof and I know people would shame me but I had to let it out.” The complaintB’s father said the purpose of his complaint wasn’t revenge: he does not want any other parent to go through this. “It is the responsibility of the social media company, the government and other agencies to stop such rumours and false posts that could take anyone’s life,” he said. “I have made a written complaint to police against the parties involved in it -- the girl who wrote the post, Instagram and people who comment and harassed my son. People do not think before making comments on social media and it is very difficult for any child to face such a situation,” he said, adding he will fight against the misuse of social media against juveniles. He said it was immense distress, shame, fear and unbearable anxieties caused by the post that drove his son to suicide. “On the evening of May 5, (a day after the suicide) a classmate of my son who lives in our society informed me about certain events that transpired the previous night between 10.30pm and 11.30pm, which led my son to commit suicide,” B’s father said. “My son was informed by his friends about the post. I was also told that my son also received illegal and unlawful threats on the phone.” A person calling himself the brother of the boy posted from an Instagram account on Thursday that B had received threat calls and texts, after which he had tried to defend himself and also told his friends he was innocent. But he couldn’t handle the constant threat. He was under tremendous pressure and had a panic attack,” read the post. Police commissioner Mohammad Akil said an investigation was on and statements would be recorded. A spokesperson for the school said they were unaware about the police complaint and its content.

They parked the scooter at the parking lot of the railway station and took receipt and walked on the railway track towards Chavaj, Bharuch C division police said. Both were mowed down by the Gujarat Express train. Their bodies were taken for postmortem, where a receipt was found in one of the pockets of Vader’s trousers.

In a Facebook post, Sathar Panthaloor, state general secretary of Samastha Kerala Sunni Students Federation (SKSSF), said attempts to hunt down Islam and religious symbols in the name of agitations cannot be tolerated. SKSSF is the student wing of the Samastha Kerala Jam-Iyyathul Uelma, the supreme body of EK faction of Sunni scholars, and Panakkad Syed Hameed Ali Shihab Thangal is its state president. Asserting that the minister should be punished if found guilty, Sathar said, “Efforts are on to denigrate the holy book and misinterpret the relationship between Kerala and the UAE. The campaign by Sangh Parivar that there is jihad in the name of distributing dates and Quran is part of the move.” Sathar said there is talk that E P Jayarajan was forced to resign because he was a Hindu and Jaleel is protected because of his Muslim identity. Certain media has drawn a cartoon, symbolically depicting the Quran, and saying these are fictions, he said. “It is not a good precedent that MPs write to the Prime Minister for a probe into the bringing of Quran from the UAE,” he said, referring to UDF convenor Benny Behanan’s missive to Narendra Modi. Sathar warned that taking discussions to this level would adversely affect ties with the UAE. Sources in Samastha said that UDF, especially IUML, is playing into the hands of BJP which is trying to whip up communal passion using the gold smuggling case. They believe that it would be suicidal for IUML to use this opportunity to settle scores with Jaleel, P K Kunhalikutty’s bete noire. SKSSF’s stand on the gold smuggling issue is likely to be discussed in coming days.

894,NEW DELHI,['21-year-old'],SC orders fresh probe into 2017 NLU students death,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday chastised the Rajasthan police for remaining clueless for three years through a lethargic probe into the cause of murder of a 21-year-old student of National Law School, Jodhpur, in 2017 and ordered a fresh probe into the case with a two month deadline for its completion. A bench of Justices R F Nariman and Navin Sinha, while allowing the appeal filed by the student's mother Neetu Kumar Nagaich, ""the investigation remained inconclusive for nearly three long years with the investigating agency sanguine of passing it off as an accidental death without coming to a firm conclusion avoiding to complete the investigation."" Referring to counsel Sunil Fernandes's arguments about the disinterested and lethargic investigation carried out by the state police, the bench said, "" It is only when we on July 8 ordered that the investigation be concluded within a period of two months and the final report be placed before us, that suddenly a very lengthy investigation closure report has been filed before us taking a stand that though the death was homicidal there was no clue."" Writing the judgment, Justice Sinha said, ""The closure report is therefore, to our mind, a clear hasty action leaving much to be desired regarding the nature of investigation, because if a detailed investigation had already been done as is sought to be now suggested, there is no reason why a final report could not have been filed by the investigating agency in the normal course of events and needed an order to do so from this Court."" ""The entire investigation and the closure report therefore lack bonafide. The interest of justice therefore requires a de novo investigation to be done, to sustain the confidence of the society in the rule of law irrespective of who the actors may be. We, therefore, set aside the closure report and direct a de novo investigation by a fresh team of investigators to be headed by a senior police officer of the State consisting of efficient personnel well conversant with use of modern investigation technology also,"" the bench said. It said that no officer, who was part of the earlier investigating team leading to the closure report, would be part of the team that would be constituted to conduct fresh investigations. ""Much time has passed and there is undoubtedly an urgency in the matter now. We therefore direct that such fresh investigation must be concluded within a maximum period of two months from today and the police report be filed before the court concerned whereafter the matter shall proceed in accordance with law,"" the SC said. The petitioner had filed the appeal through advocate Astha Sharma saying that her son Vikrant went for dinner outside the hostel on August 13, 2017 and his body was discovered near a nearby railway track the next morning. She blamed the police and the NLU of attempting to hush up the suspected foul play in the death by terming it as a suicide or an accident.

895,CHENNAI,['23-year-old'],"IIT-M student ends life, but hasn’t left any suicide note","CHENNAI: A 23-year-old student of IIT-Madras was found dead in his hostel room on Saturday morning. Police said he had hanged himself, but did not leave a suicide note. Shahal Kormath, who hailed from Manjeri in Kerala’s Malappuram district, was a final year student of the B Tech-M Tech (Dual Degree) naval architecture programme. A friend raised the alarm around 8am when Shahal did not answer the door. He alerted hostel warden Raguram Reddy who informed police. Kotturpuram police broke open room 121 to find Shahal hanging from a noose tied to the ceiling fan. Police have sent the body to Government Royapettah Hospital for an autopsy. Sources, requesting anonymity, told TOI that Shahal had been facing problems due to attendance shortage. IIT director Baskar Ramamurthi said “Kormath was not a topper but he did not have backlogs for the first seven semesters.” “His performance dropped in the last semester. We advised him to go for counselling but he decided to take help from his friends. That did not work,” Ramamurthi said. The IIT administration had informed his parents that he was short of attendance this semester. Subsequently, his brother in Bengaluru called and chided him. On Friday alone, Shahal apparently received several calls from his brother Fazil Kormath. Fazal told the Kotturpuram police that his brother had refused to answer when he called later to apologise for yelling at him. “Most students who join IIT clear very tough entrances. Most of the time there is a strong reason for performances to drop. He and his friends did not realise that they will not be able to handle their problems without professional help,” added Ramamurthi. “It is not one isolated incident that led to his death. It is a combination of many things including academic pressure, personal and family issues. Such deaths are extremely difficult and more tough for his hostel mates and friends,” said a second year student who spoke on condition of anonymity. Senior psychiatrists agree, but warn that suicides on campuses happen in clusters. “We call them copycat syndrome. One suicide triggers many others. So the institution has to prevent them now,” said Dr Lakshmi Vijayakumar, who was a part of the task force appointed to investigate suicide cases in Indian Institutes of Technology and centrally-funded educational institutions. At least four students ended their lives on campus in 2016. “IIT administrators should ensure it doesn’t happen again,” she said.

897,VIJAYAWADA,[],Education department struggles for answers as student suicides refuse to go down,"VIJAYAWADA: An unabating spate of suicides by intermediate students studying at corporate junior colleges across the state has become a major source of concern for the education department. The department, which had issued a circular to colleges on the manner of functioning and the number of working hours, is finding itself helpless due to lack of monitoring by officials on whether that circular is being implemented in earnest. Vijayawada city, with seven corporate junior colleges operating over 60 residential campuses with integrated hostels, is considered a hub for intermediate education in the state. Around a lakh students from both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana study intermediate in the city every year, and 12 students kill themselves on an average every year after failing to cope with the stress and the pressure. An alarmed education department then constituted the Chakrapani Committee last year to recommend measures for prevention of suicides by students. The committee submitted a detailed report in May 2017, spelling out a list of guidelines for educational institutions. Major guidelines included conducting only one exam a month per subject to reduce stress on students, introducing a grading system at Intermediate colleges, allowing students to use cell phones, especially those studying at residential institutions, identifying students with deformities and providing them counselling. The government tried some of theese measures in the past but with little success as the suicides continued to rise. The committee in its report flagged the harsh, demanding schedules adopted by residential junior colleges - students would be woken up at 4.30 am for ‘study hours’ and they would retire for the day at 11 pm - leaving them sleep-deprived and exhausted. The residential students were also confined to their hostels, and would be allowed out only once in a fortnight - that too only for a few hours. The committee also took objection to the weekly tests and year-long examinations that ended up creating a culture of cut-throat competition among students with many suffering from anxiety and depression. Following the recommendations of the Chakrapani Committee, the Board of Intermediate Andhra Pradesh (BIEAP) issued a circular with 18 guidelines mandating the colleges to have classes only from 9 am to 4.30 pm, compulsory playground and extracurricular activities. However, a majority of the colleges ignored these guidelines and went on conducting classes as usual. An Intermediate second year student committing suicide at a private junior college in the city on July 13 brought back the issue to stark focus, with HRD minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao directing officials to conduct a detailed enquiry and take action against the college management if necessary. Andhra Pradesh State Commission for Protection of Child Rights chairperson Ganta Hymavathi said negligence by college managements is the prime reason for student suicides at corporate educational institutions. “Students with bright futures are ending their lives due to the immense pressure, and the impact that these suicides have on the classmates and friends of the deceased is tremendous,” she said. “A majority of student suicides are reported as suspicious deaths and we have directed Vijayawada police to file 304A case against the college management for negligence,” Hymavathi said. “The Chakrapani Committee said huge curriculum and stressful atmosphere at colleges are creating suicidal tendencies in Intermediate students and has suggested guidelines. Every school and college should follow the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) guidelines and we will take measures to monitor this. We will monitor the implementation of these guidelines at private junior colleges and hostels with the support of BIEAP to control student suicides,” Hymavathi added.

904,HYDERABAD,[],Where is CM K Chandrasekhar Rao? ask angry students,"HYDERABAD: Turning their ire on Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, protesting students at the University of Hyderabad (UoH) on Friday lashed out at him for completely “ignoring” the Rohith Vemula suicide case and making no attempt at even offering condolences to the bereaved family.  While over the past five days since Vemula’s death, a string of political leaders from across the country have trooped into the university campus to express their solidarity with the students fighting for justice, KCR, they point out, has been conspicuously missing from the site of action.  “It appears that our chief minister is more concerned about the ensuing civic polls than the death of a young scholar. He has not even had the time to visit the campus till date,” said G Eshwar, president of the Dalit Students Union at UoH. He also took a potshot at KCR’s recent “shopping trip” in Hyderabad bang in the middle of the crisis at the university. Some even accused the chief minister of turning a blind eye because of Rohith’s “social and regional status”.  Satyanarayana, a visually-challenged research scholar from the university’s Telugu department, said: “Had he not been a dalit or belonged to the ‘rival’ state of Andhra Pradesh, KCR would have taken up the issue seriously. It is unfortunate that while politicians from other parts of India have travelled miles to support the movement, our CM hasn’t managed to traverse a 30-km distance to do the same.”  The fact that UoH is a Central and not a state university too was cited as a reason by students for KCR’s disinterest in the affairs of the institution.  Drawing comparisons with Osmania University, they stressed how the chief minister has always been proactive in addressing the issues of the campus there. “That’s also, perhaps, because it was the hotbed of the separate statehood movement,” claimed MA student and former member of the Ambedkar Students Association Amrit Rao. “It is a fact that KCR has conveniently washed his hands off this varsity’s crises as he feels that it is only the Union ministry’s prerogative to address them,” he added.

A large number people including members of 30-40 organisations, people's representatives and students from various colleges came together demanding justice for Kavya. They took out a huge rally from Dr B R Ambedkar Circle to DC’s office. Mayor Kavitha Sanil who took part in the protest rally, said she had come as a common citizen seeking justice to Kavya and not as the first citizen of the city. ”During my visit to her (Kavya) house, I realised that Kavya’s parents have several unanswered questions about her daughter’s death. The investigating agencies need to find an answer to these questions,” Kavitha said. Requesting political parties not to interfere in the issue, she said: “This protest is a fight for justice. I am also a national sportsperson. I know that sportspersons are not weak-hearted to commit suicide. Only a thorough investigation will bring out the truth. I also support the demand for compensation to Kavya’s family and I will do my best in this regard."" Dinakar Shetty, president, Justice for Kavya Forum, warned authorities not take the issue lightly. “There was a sea of change when the student community took to street after Nirbhaya incident in Delhi and it forced the government to amend the law. Kavya's case is as similar to Nirbhaya and that’s the reason why students have come out on the streets,” Shetty said. He alleged there is a conspiracy behind Kavya's murder and it needs to be investigated. The police too are in favour of the management, he said, alleging police were trying to hide the facts of the case. Kavya's mother Baby Poojary asked everyone to join her fight to seek justice for her daughter. She alleged that the institution heads are trying to hush up the case. “Kavya is my daughter and at the same time, she is your sister.

A division bench of Justices Ranjit More and Justice Bharati Dangre ruled recently that in the absence of any material to show that there was a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid the suicide, the trial against the petitioners (school officials) would be an “abuse of the process of law”. “There is absolutely no material to show that the petitioners abetted or instigated the deceased — Shubham — to commit the suicide. It is unfortunate that young Shubham committed suicide. It is a great loss to his parents since he was their only child. However, in our opinion, the petitioners cannot be said to be responsible for the same,” the bench said. On September 14, the HC had restrained the Dehu Road police from taking any coercive action against the five school officials in relation to the FIR lodged by Shubham’s father, Subhash Surwade. Lawyer Aniket Ujjwal Nikam, representing the petitioners, had argued that the intention to aid or to instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide was “a must for establishing an offence under Section 306” (abetment to commit suicide). He argued that neither the FIR nor the police probe disclosed any specific abetment on the part of the petitioners. Nikam cited a 2010 ruling by the Supreme Court and a 2016 judgment by the Bombay high court in support of his argument. The bench referred to the case laws cited by Nikam and observed, “It is necessary for the prosecution to at least prima facie establish that accused had an intention to aid or instigate or to abet the deceased to commit suicide. In the absence of availability of such material, the petitioners cannot be compelled to face the trial. The offence of abetment involves mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, the said person cannot be compelled to face trial.” ",06-11-2018,"['suicide', 'absence', 'instigate', 'suicide', 'abuse', 'suicide', 'unfortunate', 'suicide', 'loss', 'coercive', 'instigate', 'suicide', 'offence', 'suicide', 'instigate', 'suicide', 'absence', 'offence', 'instigate', 'suicide']"

913,NEW DELHI,[],Student suicide: SC seeks explanation from head of Amity University,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday sought explanation from founder of Amity University Ashok Chauhan on steps taken by him to help out a law student of the institution who had committed suicide after being denied to appear in exam due to poor attendance. A bench of Justices A K Goel and U U Lalit said that it was necessary for Chauhan to file affidavit to know his stand as the student Sushant Rohilla had written a mail to him before taking away his life. The apex court in September last year had taken suo motu cognisance of a letter written by Rohilla‘s friend Raghav Sharma to Chief Justice of India, blaming the Amity authorities for the suicide on August 10, 2016. The court had also appointed senior advocate F S Nariman as amicus curiae to assist in the case. Senior advocate Siddharth Luthra, appearing for the Amity University, told the bench that its law school had nothing to do with the University and there was no need to direct Chauhan to file affidavit. He said that law school was affiliated with the Indraprastha University and it followed rules and regulation of Bar Council of India. “He is not involved in the administration of the University and Amity Law school is different from the University. He has nothing to do with the school,” Luthra said. But his plea was opposed by senior advocate Fali S Nariman who contended that the Chauhan should be asked to explain what he had done after receiving mail. The bench, thereafter, directed Chauhan to file affidavit and turned down the plea of Amity University. “Let him say on oath that he has nothing to do with law school. He may have perfect explanation but he must file affidavit,” the bench said. Sharma’s letter written to CJI claimed that 20-year old Rohilla, who could not attend classes for quite some time due to reasons including his physical health, was depressed over the prospect of not being allowed to take the examination by the college because of lack of attendance. The letter sought that the apex court should take cognisance of the incident and order probe by an independent committee into such matters.

The fact that you have a difficult and toxic relationship with your parents would understandably be causing an impact on your well-being and sense of self. However, there is correspondingly a need to also be able to rely on what you have understood about them and their relationship with you over the years. An attempt needs to be made consistently to steer yourself away from the thoughts which mirror what they demonstrate towards you – that you are not good enough or that you cannot be trusted. You need to try and shift your focus towards other significant adults or relationships in your life which have been supportive and have reinforced the strengths you have and the goodness that you possess. This would allow you to create a balance in your own mind in the ways you view yourself and how it affects your moods and thought processes.

917,NAGPUR,['19-year-old'],Poverty drives Class X student to commit suicide,"NAGPUR: Faced with abject poverty and uncertain future, Anand Bhende, 19-year-old student of NMC’s Vivekanand School, committed suicide by jumping into a well close to his home in Danteshwari slums on Wednesday. In view of the financial condition of the family, people in the neighbourhood pooled in money to perform the last rites of Anand, who had appeared in the recently-held state board Class X exam. Anand was reported missing by his mother, Hira, who had filed a complaint with Bajaj Nagar police on Wednesday. The teenager’s body was spotted in the well when cops and others were searching for him. Anand was the only hope for Hira, after her husband Namdevrao, a retired cop, deserted her with three children to feed several years ago. It was her second marriage. Her first husband was electrocuted when she was in the fourth month of pregnancy. Hira gave birth to a girl. Since she was young, her parents arranged Hira’s second marriage with Namdevrao from whom she bore two children – a girl and Anand. Namdevrao subsequently deserted her to marry someone else. “Namdev left me with three children to feed. I had no source of income so I started working as domestic help,” said Hira. Many a times she had to beg to feed her children. Even in these adverse circumstances, Hira wanted her son to be educated and somehow managed the school-related expenses. “Anand wanted to become a policeman and used study a lot. He was a bright student,” she said holding son’s photograph to her chest. Hira’s daughter from the first marriage also died due to electrocution and her second daughter was married off leaving only her and Anand in the family. The duo lived in a hut that could barely accommodate a single cot and basic household material. Unable to control her tears, Hira told TOI, “Anand seemed disturbed for the last few days, but he never shared his worries. After having dinner on Tuesday night, Hira and Anand went to bed and the mother did not notice son going out. Cops said no suicide note was found from the house or the crime spot. However, initial investigation suggests Anand committed suicide out of depression due to poverty. Bajaj Nagar police have registered a case of accidental death.

Some students of the college have, however, alleged that the principal and professor, who was the invigilator at the time, had threatened Sachin that he would be rusticated from the college. The students also claimed that Sachin was reprimanded for not paying the college fees. However, the college authorities quickly rejected the allegations, saying that the student had already paid the fees and that there were no dues pending. Deputy commissioner of police (zone-II) Rahul Shrirame said, “Based on the complaint lodged by student’s father, we have registered a case of abetment of suicide against the two staffers of the MIT nursing college and that further investigation is under way.” Sachin was a first-year B.Sc (nursing) student and only son to his parents. His father works with the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) as a class-III employee.

920,CHENNAI,['22-year-old'],"Picked up by police, student found dead","CHENNAI: In a suspected case of custodial death, a trackman found a 22-year-old college student decapitated along the railway line near Gummidipoondi railway station on Saturday morning, hours after the Railway Protection Force (RPF) picked him up for questioning in connection with a case of cable theft. Locals besieged railways officials in Gummidipoondi, blaming the RPF for the death of R Moulishwaran of Chinnakavanam village, a second-year BA (political science) student at LNG College, Ponneri. Senior officers suspended RPF inspector Angadkumar and constable Vinay Kumar in connection with the student's death. The Gummidipoondi Sipcot police altered the case from CrPC Section 174 (police to probe suicide) to CrPC 176 (inquiry by magistrate into cause of death). A judicial probe is in progress. The inspector and constable, who took the student into custody early on Saturday, maintained that Moulishwaran escaped from custody and committed suicide, police said. ‘Student borrowed cellphone of trackman, threatened to kill self’Residents of Chinnakavanan village saw four men stealing cables near Ponneri late on Friday night. They caught Moulishwaran and handed him over to a railways gateman but the three others escaped. The gateman took Moulishwaran to the RPF. RPF senior divisional security commissioner Louis Amuthan said Moulishwaran escaped from custody at 7.35am. “Inspector Angadkumar and constable Vinay Kumar were questioning Moulishwaran at the Gummidipoondi RPF outpost when he asked them for permission to step out and relieve himself,” Amuthan said. “Moulishwaran, wearing only a towel around his waist, scaled the wall of the outpost. He borrowed a cellphone from a trackman, Jithendra Kumar, to make a call and threatened to commit suicide because he was worried about being booked by police.” “The trackman left after taking the phone back from Moulishwaran. When he returned, he found the body. It appears that a train had hit the student,” he said. “We have surveillance camera footage of the student escaping.” Moulishwaran’s relatives and locals tried to block trains in protest near the Gummidipoondi railway station. Some locals said they saw RPF personnel lead away three men from Chinnakavanam on Friday night, an investigating officer said. They asked the RPF men what the matter was but received no reply, he said. The protesters submitted a petition to the Ponneri revenue divisional officer, that they suspect foul play in Moulishwaran’s death. Ponneri judicial magistrate P T Satheesh Kumar has started a probe. “It appears to be a case of custodial death,” said Ramesh, a resident of Chinnakavanam. “We suspect that the RPF men placed the body on the railway tracks to make it appear like a suicide. If a probe shows that this is the case, the authorities should charge the RPF men with murder and pay compensation to Moulishwaran’s family.” ",27-08-2018,"['death', 'death', 'death', 'suicide', 'death', 'suicide', 'kill', 'stealing', 'suicide', 'worried', 'protest', 'suspect', 'foul', 'death', 'death', 'suspect', 'suicide', 'murder']"
921,COIMBATORE,[],College lecturer arrested for abetting student’s suicide,"COIMBATORE : A private college lecturer was arrested on Friday evening on charges of abetment of suicide of a male student, from whom he allegedly sought sexual favours. According to police, L Boopathy, 21, of Kottur near Pollachi, was a final year BSc (IT) student of a private arts and science college located on Valparai Road. On March 14, Boopathy had gone to Aliyar dam area. When he didn’t return home, his family members searched for him, but in vain. His father Lakshmanan then lodged a complaint with the Aliyar police, who registered a man missing case. Boopathy’s kin also gave a man missing advertisement in a vernacular daily. In response, they received call from a person from Vellore district, claiming he had kidnapped the student for ransom and demanded Rs 2 lakh in cash. The police traced the person, identified as Jegadeesh, 30, and arrested him on March 28. The preliminary investigation revealed that there was no connection between Boopathy and Jagadeesh. Meanwhile, forest guard Mahara Deepan and a few anti-poaching watchers came across a decomposed body, which was hanging from a tree, during rounds at Pollachi forest range on Friday. When alerted, the police rushed to the reserve forest along with Boopathy’s kin, who identified the body. The body was later sent to Kottur government hospital for postmortem. The police conducted inquiry with the friends of the deceased and they told the former that lecturer P Karthikeyan, 30, of Kottur Malayandipatyinam had threatened to cut Boopathy’s marks in the practical examination, if he was not ready to offer him sexual favours. The Aliyar police subsequently registered a case against Karthikeyan under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him. Further investigation is on.

922,NEW DELHI,['22-year-old'],Jamia mystery: Police claim texts indicate suicide,"NEW DELHI: Two days after a 22-year-old student from Jamia Milia Islamia was found shot inside his car in south Delhi’s Sarojini Nagar on Tuesday, police claimed that they had evidence which indicated that it was a case of suicide. DCP (south) Romil Baaniya said that investigating team had found sections of a WhatsApp conversation between the deceased Rizwan Khan and a woman, where he has written that he would shoot himself. Police said that a preliminary probe has revealed that Khan was in love with the woman but despite his advances, he wasn’t getting a response from her. Spurned, he planned to kill himself, police claimed. Khan’s mobile phone, which was recovered from the spot, was analysed on Wednesday where the conversation between him and the woman were scrutinised. There, cops claimed that they saw that the girl was ignoring his advances which had agitated him a lot. Police sources said that Khan went to the woman’s house in Sarojini Nagar to meet her but couldn’t do so. Cops claimed that Khan sat in his car the entire night, probably trying to contact her. The WhatsApp conversation showed that Khan expressed his love to the woman and told her that if she doesn’t accept it, he would shoot himself. When he did not get a desired response, he shot himself in his temple. The deceased’s family members have contradicted the theory of suicide and stated that he was instead killed by the woman’s family. They told cops about receiving a call on Tuesday morning from someone who informed them that he had left a bag at their home and that they should collect it. Police officers said that they are still probing the matter under an inquest under section 174 of the CrPC. The woman is also being questioned about more information about her relationship with Khan, who was a state-level hockey player. ",07-12-2017,"['suicide', 'kill', 'suicide', 'killed']"

924,BEGUSARAI/ PATNA,"['21-year-old', '17-year-old']",Begusarai youth hangs self in police custody,"BEGUSARAI/ PATNA: A 21-year-old youth, who was arrested for eloping with a minor, committed suicide in police custody in Begusarai after he was informed that his girlfriend had given a statement accusing him of abducting her, police said on Wednesday. Vikram Kumar, a Class XII student of a local undergraduate college, hanged himself from the ceiling fan in a room near the lockup inside Birpur police station on Tuesday evening soon after he came to know that his 17-year-old girlfriend, who studies in the same college, had “betrayed” him in court. Kumar, a native of Parra village under Birpur police station in Begusarai district, and his girlfriend were traced to New Delhi on Monday and were brought to Birpur where he was interrogated in a kidnapping case filed by the girl’s father. The girl was sent to the sadar hospital for medical examination and later produced in a court where she recorded her statement on Tuesday. The girl, who is from the same village as Kumar, told the court that she was kidnapped for marriage and subsequently taken to New Delhi by the accused. “Kumar was allowed to go out as he wanted to use the toilet. But due to laxity on the part of the constable on duty, he sneaked inside a room near the lock up and hanged himself with the ceiling fan. Realising that the boy is taking too long, the constable started looking for him and found him hanging in the room,” SHO Amar Kumar said. As the news about the custodial death spread in the town, Kumar’s family members and relatives gathered outside the police station demanding a probe. SDPO Rajan Sinha reached the police station to pacify the crowd and the body was sent to the sadar hospital for autopsy. The victim’s father, Dukho Poddar, demanded a fair investigation and action against the police personnel. Sinha said the SHO of Birpur police station was out when the incident took place on Tuesday evening. “The SHO was on patrolling duty to enforce the lockdown in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak,” SDPO Sinha told this newspaper over phone. He, however, hastened to add that he had recommended disciplinary action against the SHO for his negligence. Later, the SHO was shifted to the police lines. Begusarai SP Awakash Kumar said a medical team was set up to conduct the autopsy and the process was video recorded as per guidelines of the National Human Rights Commission. Earlier, DM Arvind Kumar Verma ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident. ",26-03-2020,"['suicide', 'accusing', 'death', 'outbreak', 'negligence']"
925,DEHRADUN,['22-year-old'],MBBS student commits suicide at Srinagar Medical College,"DEHRADUN: After failing to cope with study pressure, a 22-year-old MBBS student at Srinagar Medical College allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself in her hostel room on Saturday night. However, the parents of the girl raised doubts over the incident and approached the police to register a case.  The deceased girl, identified as Shivani Bansal, a native of Jaspur in Udham Singh Nagar district, was a fourth year MBBS student. A suicide note, addressed to her parents, has been recovered from her room. The note mentioned ‘non-interest in MBBS and examination pressure’ as the reason behind the extreme step.  According to inspector Narendra Bisht, in-charge of Srinagar police station, “Shivani was a fourth year MBBS student and was found hanged from the ceiling fan in her room. Prima facie it seems that she was not interested in medical studies and was also not being able to cope up with study pressure.”  On Saturday night, police received a call from the warden of senior girl’s hostel in Srinagar Medical College stating that one of the students did appear for her final examinations on Saturday afternoon and is not responding to phone calls or opening her room since then.  “Upon receiving information, a police team rushed to the girl’s hostel. We climbed up the ventilator and found her hanging and the room’s door was opened by breaking the lock,” inspector Bisht said.  Shivani had left a suicide note addressed to her parents, sister and brother, in her room stating that she never wanted to pursue MBBS and was finally giving up as she could not cope with study pressure, Bisht said.  When contacted, Dr Chandra Mohan Rawat, principal of Srinagar Medical College, said, “MBBS is one of the toughest courses in the world and one should be mentally, emotionally and physically strong to keep the zeal for good five years. It seems she succumbed to study pressure.”  Rawat added that Shivani was running one year behind in the course as she had to drop in the first year due to attendance deficiency and failing in the supplementary examination. “Parents should not force their children to pursue courses that don’t interest them. Instead, kids should be allowed to choose their career of choice,” he said.  Police said that Shivani was a topper in high school and intermediate but she failed in the supplementary examination in the first year of MBBS, which dented her self-confidence.  Meanwhile, her family has raised questions on the suicide note and complained to the police that someone pressurized their daughter to commit suicide and write the note. “On her father’s complaint, we have filed a case under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). Although, it looks to be a case of suicide, we will investigate all angles,” inspector Bisht said.

926,MUMBAI,['15-year-old'],Mumbai Class IX student jumps off 14th floor,"MUMBAI: A 15-year-old leapt off the 14th floor of a Kandivli (east) highrise early on Tuesday after he was allegedly reprimanded for excessive use of cellphones and social media. A resident spotted the teenager sitting on a ledge nearly half an hour before the tragedy and alerted security, but by the time a guard reached the spot, he had jumped. The teen left behind a note on Instagram Stories apologizing to everyone. The boy was good in studies and had cleared his Class IX exams in the IGCSE stream of a Kandivli school. An avid footballer, he was also training at an Andheri-based football academy. As his parents travel extensively for their travel and tourism business, the boy and his older sister spent most of their time with their grandfather who lived in the highrise. Their parents own a flat in the adjacent building. Around 5.30am on Tuesday, a 10th-floor resident of the highrise was cooking when she saw the teenager seated on the ledge of the refuge area on the 14th floor of the opposite wing. “It was dark and I could not see his face. I could only see his legs dangling from the ledge and immediately called up a security guard,” she told TOI. Ten minutes later, the teen had not moved from his position and she called up the guard again. The guard told her that he had informed his supervisor and the latter was on his way up. Around 5.55am, when another resident was headed for her morning walk, she heard a loud thud. The teen is believed to have plunged to his death just as the supervisor reached the 14th floor. A pair of headphones and a portable speaker was found on the ledge. The guards immediately informed his mother and sister who rushed to the highrise. His father, who is currently in Canada on work, is yet to reach India. Friends said the teen was speaking to a friend on the phone around 1.30am when his mother entered his room and reprimanded him for being hooked to gadgets and asked him to get some sleep. Around 3am, he posted a message on Instagram Stories, which read: “Sorry if I’ve ever done any of y’all wrong.” He also posted two other pictures on Instagram—one with a female friend and another with a male friend. He captioned these two pictures, “I got real ones, love you both a lot.” While his grieving family refused to speak on the tragedy, his friends said he had showed no signs of being troubled till Monday evening. “He hung out with us, laughed and cracked jokes on Monday evening. He did not seem upset at all,” said a close friend. Another added that the teen was good at academics. “Our results were out quite a while back and he was under no pressure from his family as far as studies were concerned. We have no clue what went wrong,” he said. The police will examine the teen’s cellphone and social media accounts to find out if he killed himself for any other reason. An accidental death case has been registered. The post-mortem examination is yet to be conducted.

P Prakash, 24, a topper at the college, took the extreme step allegedly due to harassment by some of the faculty members of the college, including the head of the department (HoD), according the suicide note he left. Prakash, a native of Adugamparai, was found hanging from a roadside tree on Wednesday at Konamedu in Vellore taluk police station limits. He had recorded a video and also left a three-page suicide note before taking the extreme step. He says in the video that he wanted to pursue his studies well. But at the same time he feared that the HoD at the college would not allow him to complete the course. He was targeted by the HoD and had been humiliated by him in front of his classmates on several occasions. The family members of Prakash said he took the issue to the college principal, but no action was taken. “The principal did nothing to ensure a good environment for him (Prakash) to continue his studies,” said a family friend of Prakash. “The HoD sir will not allow me to complete the course as he thinks that I am creating problems. So, he will continue to torture me indirectly,” said Prakash in the suicide note. He has been skipping classes for the last two weeks without the knowledge of his parents. “I was not able to tell you, mom and dad, that I cannot go to the college. Hence, I have decided to end my life,” police said quoting Prakash’s suicide note. The HoD had also questioned Prakash about his personal matters including, his faith, caste and religion. It went beyond a limit and he was isolated, police said. Prakash’s elder brother Pratap, who is working in Bengaluru, said that he joined BBA in Voorhees College and discontinued the course after two years to pursue his dream to become an artist. “Before committing suicide, he messaged his brother and uploaded a video and the suicide note on his Facebook page. On seeing this, one of his friends contacted his mother and alerted her around 3.40 pm on Wednesday,” said a family friend of Prakash. Prakash’s father Parthiban and his relatives’ frantic search ended in vain as they received a call from the police that a youth was found hanging in Konamedu at about 6 pm. The Vellore taluk police registered a case under section 174 of CrPC and an inquiry is on. Police shifted Prakash’s body to the Government Vellore Medical College Hospital for post-mortem.

931,PUNE,[],A teacher’s passion for students’ mental health rooted in feminism,"PUNE: India has one of the world’s highest suicide rates among the youth. According to data released by the National Crime Records Bureau, 15 people ended their lives every one hour in the country in 2015. So worrying is the data that the WHO called India the suicide capital of the South-East in 2014. Experts say stress is to blame. The University Grants Commission swung into action last year, ordering the setting up of student counselling systems across the country’s colleges. Teachers opened their doors and psychologists were brought in to deal with the crisis. However, one department of a college in the city has been quietly at work to mitigate this crisis for a long time. They started over 25 years ago, much before the rest of the country realised many of our young were dying. Sadhana Natu, a teacher at the Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce, Pashan Road, has been running a peer support group, one-on-one counselling centre, and tertiary support and skill development programmes... all without fanfare. Disha is “speak out” platform for students, which was started to create a space for students to speak, share, learn from each other, and evolve. “The sessions are usually conducted by our student coordinators once or twice a month. Students meet and discuss problems. Minor issues get mitigated in these meets,” said Natu, an associate professor and head of the psychology department. There is also a referral group. This group refers students to the counselling cell whenever it is felt that one-on-one help is required. Natu said her background as a women’s rights activist, student activist and a feminist that made her start the peer pressure group just three years into the job. Natu’s love for students is evident as every programme she organizes is for them. “We have a programme called Koshish. It sends students on internships. Often, the organizations like the students’ work and offer them placements. But I want them to excel, and try to get students to complete their PG,” said Natu, who alsoteaches at SPPU’s Women Studies Centre. While loneliness among students is rampant, suicidal tendencies, depression, the feeling of alienation etc. is also on the rise. “The definition of loneliness is subjective. Even the definition of wellbeing differs from person to person. We had a case of two friends. One of them started performing well in studies, while the other wasn’t. Things got toxic between them. One may think the poor performing student would have been referred to me, but it was the other student who was in distress,” said Natu.

933,KALYANI,[],IISER student kills self; was struggling with English skill,"KALYANI: A meritorious student from the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER) was found hanging from the ceiling of the Kalyani campus’s hostel washroom on Monday. Sagar Mandal was from the Scheduled Castes and came from a village 6km from the premier central institute. A section of the faculty as well as his friends said the son of a mason was undergoing treatment for hypertension and was “suffering from inferiority complex and a problem of low grades because of lack of proficiency in English”. His family alleged he was being “pushed into taking drugs”. Haringhata cops on Tuesday registered a murder case against unknown people following a complaint from the headmaster of Fatehpur High School, where Sagar studied till Class XII. Earlier on Tuesday, neighbours of the first-generation college-goer blocked the Boro Jaguli-Nagar Ukhra Road crossing. Institute authorities, however, denied there was any drugs or ragging problem on the campus. “There is no way he could be a victim of ragging or peer pressure to take drugs. The institute is very strict in such matters. There has been no complaint of anyone being forced into drugs. It’s also unlikely that his academic performance might have prompted him to commit suicide. We have formed a fact-finding committee to look into what exactly caused the incident,” IISER-Kolkata dean Arindam Kundagrahi said. Sagar was found hanging on Monday afternoon inside the second-floor washroom of the Nivedita Hall, the hostel where he stayed with two others as roommates. His friends said he studied till late into the night on Sunday and left his room around 2 a.m. on Monday. The others at the hostel assumed that he had gone to the 24-hour-open library and continued with their studies. His absence was noted only on Monday, when he did not appear for the Earth Science paper in college. A search on the campus led to his body a couple of hours later. “He was a bright student but his grades dropped in the first semester of the second year. He scored very low grades in Earth Science’s Seismology paper. He was supposed to write another Earth Science paper (on Geophysics),” an M.Sc student of the institute said. “We all knew he wasn’t very comfortable with English and these papers needed long-ish answers. Had he failed in Earth Science this semester, he would have lost his scholarship for a year,” the M.Sc student said. Sagar evidently realised this; he called up a friend on Sunday night and expressed fears that he might not pass Earth Science this semester. Sagar scored a grade of 7.78 in his first year second semester but his grade dropped to 7.46 in the first semester of the second year, the dip coming with a very low grade in Earth Science. “There was no reason why a student of Sagar’s merit could have found one subject so difficult. It was his problem with English that troubled him in papers that needed more explanatory writing,” said a student of B.Sc second year. Sagar’s family and neighbours broke down when his body was released after an autopsy. “He could not have committed suicide, he was a fighter,” his father, Sushanta, said as the body was placed on a ground in front of the family home at Fatehpur’s Majherpara. Sagar’s sister, Rekha, claimed that he was being pushed into drugs by some of his friends. He kept on refusing but the pressure on him was growing, she said. WhatsApp messages that Sagar sent his friends, which TOI accessed, revealed that he had gone to Vellore to get treated for hypertension.

939,"(This story originally appeared in  on Apr 21, 2017)NEW DELHI",[],"IITs wake up to suicide threats, conduct parent-teacher meets & creative exercises","(This story originally appeared in  on Apr 21, 2017)NEW DELHI: A rise in suicides and attempted suicides at India’s premier engineering institutes has turned the authorities edgy, forcing them to take a diverse range of measures to help destress students.  The initiatives include parent-teacher meetings — heard of only in schools — at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi to connecting with nature through tree-hugging campaigns at IIT Kharagpur and counselling at IIT Madras and IIT (Banaras Hindu University) Varanasi. To help students deal with stress, IIT Guwahati has set up a creativity centre where students dance, sing and play instruments.  IIT Bombay is adding two counsellors and a psychiatrist to its staff. Students at these prestigious institutes often spiral into depression on account of daunting academic challenges and expectations and pressure to perform from parents and peers.  Since January 2016, there have been about a dozen suicide deaths and attempts at the IITs. There’s also been an increase in the number of students seeking counselling. Of the total visits made by people aged 18 to 25 seeking help, 70% are pursuing professional courses such as medicine and engineering, according to Cosmos Institute of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences, a New Delhi-based provider of mental healthcare services.  The number of students visiting CIMBS for counselling has risen by 12.5% in the past year, said Shobhana Mittal, associate consultant psychiatrist and psychotherapist.  It’s usually the freshers who face pressure and are prone to stress, having made it into the IITs after sustained efforts, sometimes over a few years, preparing for the joint entrance examination.  “First-year students are often found burnt out. Most students are not well-rounded personalities as a result of 18 hours of coaching for last three years before cracking JEE,” said Soumyo Mukherji, dean of student affairs at IIT Bombay.  It’s a whole new world for students who enter the IITs after clearing the tough JEE and many are overwhelmed as they find themselves among other high performers. “It is often found that most of the depressed students at IIT Madras were pushed by parents to enter the IITs.  In many cases, it turns out that their interests are different from engineering,” said G Ranga Rao, chief advisor of Mitr, a unit that responds to cases of depression among students at IIT Madras.  Last year, IIT Madras split its guidance and counselling unit into Mitr and Saathi, a wing that takes proactive steps to check depression among students.  “Focus here is more on proactive steps as most students do not come forward. We need to catch them,” Rao said. The institute, which already has two counsellors, is now looking at adding three more.  IIT Kharagpur is implementing an innovative idea to reach out to students through programmes with a different theme each month to help them develop a positive attitude.  January was a month of gratitude and in February, students observed 28 days of random acts of kindness. March was about helping students answer the question, ‘What are you proud of ?’ “This month it is about connecting with nature and building resilience.  As trees are most resilient, each student will identify special trees and try connecting to them,” an IIT Kharagpur spokesperson told ET.  IIT Kharagpur recently launched a Facebook page especially to respond to students facing pressure.  It has round-the-clock counsellors to take calls, which touched almost 3,000 in the past year. There are over 11,000 students at IIT Kharagpur.  The opening of the creativity centre last year at IIT Guwahati, which has over 1,500 students as of this month, appears to be working.  “In the last one year, IIT Guwahati has not reported any suicide case. There is definitely a dip in depression among students here, especially with the opening up of this centre,” said its director, Gautam Biswas.  With a recent suicide case haunting IIT BHU, the institute kicked off a three-week induction programme in July where students are taught art, music, painting and dance forms by the faculty from Banaras Hindu University. To ensure a smooth settling down, the students are taken around to visit monuments, temples and mosques and taught human values.  “Induction programme helps to open up students and give them a larger view of the world. We try to teach how to embrace failure (including academics) and treat it as a minor hiccup,” said its director, Rajeev Sangal. He added that the institute is hiring counsellors.  IIT Delhi started an academic mentoring this year where lowperforming juniors get special attention from seniors and faculty members. “We are in the process of formalising a schedule for students to mentor the juniors on a daily basis,” said Sangeeta Kohli, a faculty member involved with student activities at IIT Delhi.

Manik Sharma — son of Chander Shekhar Sharma, an RSS worker and resident of Basti Danishmandan area — killed himself with his father’s licensed weapon. In his one-line suicide note, he wrote, “Mein bahut bura hoon (I am very bad).” It is learnt that Manik, who was a student of a local college, was not doing well in his studies, due to which his father asked him to focus on studies and also to stay away from games on his mobile phone. “He would remain busy with games on his mobile phone including PUBG. I would ask him to focus on studies as his performance was going down. Once he even broke his phone in a fit of rage but was soon back to his ways. He had entered part three of BBA and had scored low marks. I would often admonish him for playing games on phone and even in the morning, I had pulled him up and asked him to focus on studies,” said a shocked father. He said he was away at his shop when Manik took the extreme step. He had taken out his father's licensed revolver and shot himself in the chest and died instantly. Manik was the only son of his parents and his two sisters were elder to him. Chander Shekhar Sharma is an active member of RSS and runs a chemist shop in the area.

Hours before, her parents rebuked him for not giving attention to her studies. The student has been identified as Bunty Ray. The parents had gone out to see a doctor. They found the 10-year-old dead when they returned home. Police suspect it to be a case of suicide. This is not an isolated case of a student taking a step as extreme as suicide after being reprimanded. The city has seen several such cases of students committing suicide related to study pressure. Psychologists and psychiatrists feel that parents should be supportive instead of being pushy. “Because of the rapid transition in economic and social structure, parents have sky-high expectations from their children. This makes them become pushy when they are required to hold hands and help their children,” said Dr Sabyasachi Mitra, consultant psychiatrist. Mitra said in India a student commits suicide every hour — eastern and southern part of the country being the most vulnerable. The high aspiration of the parents percolates down to the children as young as 10 years who are still ignorant about the nitty-gritty of the economical and social transition. Adding to it is the gap between tolerance and frustration that has become very thin. “Removal of reward is one way of dealing with a child when he’s not complying with the parents’ instructions, instead of rebuking or behaving harshly with them. And if the parents do not know how to deal with such child they should seek professional help,” said Dr Mitra. Parents cited pressure to do well in academics as the trigger for them to be tough with kids. “I have to talk tough to my son at times. But Ialways make it a point to explain it to him why I scold him. I also pamper him when he plays,” said Mousumi Chakraborty, mother of a Class VII student.

The trial of the two accused – Fr Thomas Kottoor and Sister Sephy that continued in this court – concluded on Dec 10. Sr Abhaya (19) was found dead in the well of St Pius X Convent in Kottayam on March 27, 1992. She was the daughter of Ayikkarakunnel Thomas and Leelamma of Areekara in Kottayam and a second-year pre-degree student of BCM College, Kottayam then. The case was initially probed for 17 days by the local police, following which the probe was handed over to the crime branch. They finished the investigation in nine months and submitted a final report before the court on Jan 30, 1993, concluding that Sr Abhaya’s death was a case of suicide. However, on Mar 29, 1993, CBI took over the case following the intervention of government. State government recommended CBI to take over the case after accepting 34 memorandums in this regard from various organizations, action councils and individuals. CBI concluded that it was a case of homicide. Three persons were listed as accused in the chargesheet filed by CBI’s probe team. They were Fr Thomas Kottoor, Fr Jose Poothrukayil and Sr Sephy. CBI’s finding was that Sr Abhaya saw the trio in a compromising situation in the kitchen of the convent when she came to drink water and they killed her fearing that she might reveal their affair. The accused struck her from behind twice using an axe. When she fell unconscious, they took her body outside and dumped it in the well. The chargesheet was submitted on Jul 17, 2009. Following this, the three accused filed discharge petitions before the court. A year ago, CBI court let off Jose Poothrukayil citing that there was no sufficient evidence against him.

The next day, after his parents brought it to the notice of the school authorities, the victim was made to sit on the front bench. The bullies were warned and let off. The parents alleged they had brought the bullying to the notice of the school every week, but the matter was taken lightly. Tuling police inspector Kishore Khairnar said they visited the school and spoke to students who named the three boys, who are known to harass students. “A case of ragging has been filed against the boys aged 13 and 14 years. The teens as well as their parents have been questioned,” said Khairnar. The boys, who stay in the same locality as the victim, have denied their involvement. Dr Ajay Jadhav of Alliance Hospital, where the victim has been admitted, said though he is on ventilator, his condition is improving. He said the boy was being monitored 24x7. Police interrogated the principal, who is the complainant in the case, as well as school authorities. As of now, no case has been made against the school. Khairnar said they will wait for the victim to recover so that he can provide details. The victim’s parents have also given their statement.

955,NASHIK,['32-year-old'],Maharashtra: Farmer ends life the day his son recites poem on suicide,"NASHIK: Malhari Batule, a 32-year-old farmer from the Pathardi taluka of Ahmednagar district, allegedly ended his life by consuming poison on Thursday night. Ironically, the same morning, Batule’s son — a Class III student at a government school — had recited a short poem on the topic of farmers’ suicide on the occasion of Marathi Bhasa Day. The young boy had highlighted the need for farmers to desist from taking such a harsh step, as it serves no purpose. The Pathardi police sources said Batule was rushed to a hospital in Ahmednagar city for treatment, but he later succumbed. At present, the police have registered a case of accidental death. “We think the farmer may have ended his life as he had a substantial amount of loan to repay,” the police sources said. Police insiders added that the farmer had taken a loan of more than Rs 20 lakh and had bought a truck. Moreover, it was also his responsibility to repay a loan of Rs 8 lakh that his father had taken to buy a tractor. “As per the initial information that we have, the farmer was facing a financial crisis. He was finding it difficult to repay two loan installments,” police sources said. As per the rules, the police and the local revenue department would carry out separate probes to ascertain whether the farmer ended his life purely due to agrarian crisis. The reports would be submitted to the district administration panel to asses whether the bereaved family is eligible for monetary compensation from the government. A pall of gloom had descended on the Bharajwadi village after the villagers came to know of the incident. The deceased farmer is survived by his wife, three children and parents.

956,BENGALURU,[],Police search for clues after IFS officer hangs himself in Bengaluru flat,"BENGALURU: A senior Indian Forest Service officer committed suicide at his flat in a tony complex in north Bengaluru on Sunday morning. Awtar Singh, 52, an additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), forest resource management, Aranya Bhavan, Bengaluru, who was from Haryana, was found hanging from a wire tied to the ceiling in his flat in Prestige Monte Carlo apartments on Doddaballapur Road in Yelahanka, police said. Yelahanka New Town police registered a case but were yet to ascertain what prompted the 1990 batch officer to take his own life. Singh did not leave behind a suicide note, but may have had family or health problems, investigators said, adding that they were looking for clues to establish why the officer killed himself. Bheemashankar S Guled, deputy commissioner of police (northeast), told TOI that the officer was found dead in his fourth-floor flat around 10.30 am. “He had severe back pain for some time, which may have led him to commit suicide,” he said. “Yelahanka New Town police are investigating the case.” Singh’s wife and two children told police that he appeared to be well on Sunday morning, an investigating officer said. “Singh finished his regular walk on Sunday morning, had breakfast and went to his room,” he said. “His wife later knocked on the door several times but failed to get a response. She alerted neighbours who broke open the door. They found Singh hanging from the ceiling.” “Family members said the only thing he was upset about was his health,” he added. “They suspects that could have led to the suicide.” Mandeep Kaur, Singh’s homemaker wife, told police that her husband had had chronic back pain for several years. Doctors could not cure it and treatment failed to alleviate the pain, she said. “My husband complained that he could not even sit down, not even when he went to the toilet, because of his backache,” the officer quoted Kaur as saying. Police moved the body to Dr BR Ambedkar Medical College and Hospital, where an autopsy was conducted. They later handed over the body to family members, who will take it to Singh’s hometown of Yamunanagar in Haryana for the final rites. Forest officers were stunned when they heard of Singh’s death. “Singh was a good colleague,” a senior forester said. “He was a calm and efficient officer. No one had heard of him lobbying for prominent posts at any time in his career. We were shocked to hear about the suicide this morning.” Another forest officer said Singh had lived in the flat near Anantapur Gate in Yelahanka New Town for several years. Singh’s son is a secondyear BE student at an engineering college in the city; his daughter is a Class 9 student. Noting that Singh was an introvert and appeared to have been depressed for a fortnight or so, a senior forester suggested that something beyond work or health problems could have triggered the suicide. “He was reserved and never shared personal matters with his colleagues,” he said. “A thorough investigation by the police is needed to reveal the cause.” Chief minister BS Yediyurappa currently holds the forest department portfolio.

957,TRICHY,[],Minors named in suicide case may face grim future,"TRICHY: The four boys who were arrested on Friday after being named by their classmate as the bullies who were behind his decision to end his life are likely to face tough times. The Class 10 students were sent to the government observation home in the city and may face charges of abetting the suicide of R Ranjith, 15. Ranjith’s suicide by hanging at his house in Mandhurai near Lalgudi was the second such incident in Trichy after two Class 10 girls of a government school in Vaiyampatti committed suicide by jumping in front of a train at Vaiyampatti in August 2017. Like Ranjith’s suicide note blaming the taunts of his four classmates, the two girls also had named two boys and a girl for indulging in character assassination. The boys would languish in the home at least for a week until they got a bail. The government observation home in Trichy city usually receives minor boys and girls involved in petty and also heinous crimes. Hence the four boys would also get close to such juveniles in conflict with law during their stay. The consequences would be serious for such minors as the educational institution may avoid re-admitting the students in their school. It happened to the two boys and girl in the first case who were forced to take their exams as private students. In Ranjith’s case, the four boys allegedly bullied him by commenting that he had a feminine look. “In the case of the two girls, the three boys and the girls had allegedly talked ill of the girls publicly over a love affair. Unable to bear the mental agony, they committed suicide. The three were kept in the government observation home and released a few months ago,” said a member of the Juvenile Justice Board, Trichy, M Padmavathy on Saturday. She said, “Preliminary reports say that the four boys allegedly bullied Ranjith saying that he is becoming a transgender. It is not sure whether he really had any biological change. If the third gender is given proper respect in the society, there would be no reason for feeling insulted by such taunts and taking extreme steps,” she said.

959,"The suicide of 18-year-old engineering student Jishnu Pranoy has brought to the fore the academic stress, the burden of expectations and the fragility in the minds of Gen Z, who tend to go to the extreme of taking their lives. Jishnu was caught for allegedly copying in the first semester exam and berated by his professor. According to his batch mates, he was further grilled after being taken to the principal’s office. His friends describe him as ambitious, intelligent and talented. He had even brought laurels to the school at higher secondary level by presenting an innovative science project. They recall that he dreamt of establishing a start up and had even named his company, COMMOS. It comes as a shocker when someone who had thought so far ahead took his life at a moment’s impulse. We talk to students, educationists and psychologists to find out what makes our youngsters fragile and why they can’t handle life with all its challenges. Ranjith KS (name changed on request), an engineering student says that he is at a point in his life where he is convinced that he is not meant to be an engineer but does not have the heart to drop out of the course.  “After my plus two, like everybody, I too joined for an engineering course. My house is in Calicut but I am studying in Trivandrum. I am unable to cope with the curriculum and have 12 papers to clear from my previous four semesters. My parents aren’t aware of it. They have taken education loan pledging our property. I am unable to discuss this with the teachers too. I don’t know what the future holds for me and often I get suicidal thoughts.”  The above is not an isolated case. Many students in professional colleges go through the same cycle. Aptitude mattersResearcher and theatre personality Devendranath Shankaranarayanan says that as we live in a world where money is given precedence over a child’s interest that could be the reason for Ranjith’s suicidal thoughts. Educationist B S Warrier makes it clear that the problem needs to be addressed from the roots. He says that in many cases students are forced to enrol in course in which they don’t have any aptitude. “None of the courses in Kerala has a curriculum which is difficult for a student, with an interest in that subject to handle. The question we should ask is whether the student is really interested in studying it. So let’s stop blaming the college or the education system. Also it’s high time that we counsel our children that suicide is never a solution for problems.” Devendranath adds, “In the past, students were given freedom to choose their field of study based on their interest than what the parents wanted them to be in. After the invasion of self-financing colleges, we reached a state, where anyone can become anything, if they have the money. And everybody wants their children to be engineers, doctors and MBA graduates. Hence, it became children’s responsibility to compensate for the money their parents had invested in their education. This is where the stress starts building up.” On Jishnu suicide, Devendranath says that the expectations and demands are what could have led to him taking his life. “I would blame it all on the monetary-based education system. As long as it continues, the parents, teachers and the students will be under infinite stress.” Absence of realistic approach to lifeThe Gen Z kids are being more connected to the virtual world than the realistic one and the stress level increases when they encounter a real problem, says Dr Piyush Antony, Clinical Psychologist. “Blame it on the consumerist competitive world. We bring up children making them consider the good boy-good girl tags as the epitome of discipline. And when that image crashes children are unable to cope,” she says.  She asserts that creating a favourable environment for students either directly or in the virtual world is critical to reduce such incidents. “By introducing helplines and counselling sessions which are supported by Parent Teachers’ association, colleges can create a healthy ambience. Parents should always understand that while working hard to improve the intelligent quotient of a child they should also consider their emotional quotient.” Empowering Gen Z to handle failures Sukanya AS, an assistant professor says that unlike the earlier generation, youngsters today are brought up in such a way that they can’t handle even the simplest of real-life problems. She says, “Students’ upbringing plays an important part in their personality development. They are not told by parents that they will have to face problems in life and should develop the capacity to overcome it.” She also insists that teachers too need to be sensitive towards the students. Educationist B S Warrier concurs the need for teaching children to handle failures. “The Gen Z is becoming more fragile as they are never taught to handle failures. We should educate them that failure is the stepping stone to success,” he says.  Elaborating on the responsibility of teachers, Sukanya says, “Teachers have to build up such a rapport with the students that they feel free to openly discuss about any wrongdoings of theirs. Also, when you scold a student in public, you may never know if he or she is hiding the pain inside, and if it would leave a scar for life. ”  It seems parents are also under immense pressure when it comes to moulding the children’s mind set. Shajna Rakesh, parent of two teenagers says, “Parenting has become pampering, these days. Those who shout at children or try to guide them are looked down upon. But we fail to realise that we need to enforce certain degree of discipline and inculcate the need for adaptability among them.” Before concluding she highlights, “The power to face crisis and also the logic to handle it has been missing as we tend to adopt a soft approach to parenting, which needs an overhaul.”",['18-year-old'],Stress?

But here’s a rare case in which a father, a life convict for murder, and his son, a student of St Mary’s school in Papanasam, tasted victory together in Class XII exams recently. K Sukumar, the father, scored 320 marks, and his son, Suresh, secured 431 marks. However, the father and son couldn’t celebrate the victory together due to the pandemic-imposed restrictions at the Palayamkottai Central Prison in Tirunelveli where the father is undergoing his life imprisonment since 2004. “I am happy for my father who also passed Class XII. I am a bit upset that I am unable to share our victory together. I will soon visit him with a packet of laddu,” said Suresh who wants to pursue diploma in electrical engineering. Suresh knew his father was appearing for Class XII exams as he had passed Class 10 exam two years ago. “When I met him last, he told me to study well. I also told him to do the same. We wished each other. We both wanted to pass the exam during our first appearance itself. I am happy that we could do that,” he added. Interestingly, Suresh’s sister Meena had passed the Class 10 exam recently. The children of incarcerated parents always suffer a lot. “Suresh scored a good mark. And it was expected because he was a brilliant student. We will let him pursue higher studies with the help of sponsors,” said K R Raja, psychiatric counselor and co-founder of Global Network for Equality (GNE), an NGO based in Tirunelveli that works for the welfare of the children of incarcerated parents. Sukumar was sentenced to life imprisonment after he murdered a relative due to a family dispute in 2004. When he was on parole in 2014, another disaster took place. His wife committed suicide due to depression. Upset over the incident, Sukumar sent his two children to his mother’s house. Raja said when he informed Sukumar about his son’s achievement, he was happy. “He (Sukumar) asked us whether his son would be pursuing his higher studies. We assured him that we would take care of it,” said Raja, who has been taking care of the studies of the two children since 2015.

The blood samples were of O+ group, which was the blood group of Jishnu and as well as that of both his parents. Following this the investigating officers on Tuesday took blood samples from the parents of Jishnu Asokan and Mahija for carrying out DNA tests. These tests are expected to confirm whether the blood traces detected at the college room were that of Jishnu. The blood samples of the parents were collected at the Taluk hospital at Nadapuram, in Kozhikode, in presence of the members of the special investigating team from Thrissur. According to the top police sources the blood samples detected at the college room were analysed at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Thiruvananthapuram. In fact, the relatives and friends of the deceased had informed the police about the blood stains in the body of Jishnu as well as in the bathroom where the body was found on January 6. But the police dismissed these suspicions. The family members later released the audio of the telephonic conversations of fellow student of Jishnu saying blood samples were seen on the body and in the bathroom. Subsequently, forensic experts examined the college rooms and detected blood stains in the rooms of the vice principal and the PRO. The investigating team then collected samples from the rooms for analyses. The DNA tests on the blood samples will be carried out with the permission of the Judicial first class magistrate of Wadakkanchery where the police have filed the case relating to the “unnatural death’’ of Jishnu.

Student suicides are becoming increasingly common in Hyderabad, considered the capital of IIT coaching after Kota in Rajasthan. This, child rights activists alleged, is because parents and commercial coaching centres are pressurising students into striving for unrealistic goals. The recent case of a 19-year-old second-year intermediate student of a corporate college in Bachupally stands testimony to this.His was the third student suicide to rock the city in August this year. “Of the 25 suicides that were registered in the past few months, 12 were boys and 13 were girls.

The SHRC issued a notice to the principal secretary of education, Ranjeeva Acharya, on Thursday , seeking a report on the increasing student suicides in educational institutions by November 16, 2017.

Replying to the discussion on governor’s address in the legislative council on Thursday, Pawar said there is no reason to back anyone who poses a threat to national security adding that all should take sensible positions on crucial issues. A complaint has been filed against Usmani for making anti-Hindu remarks and hurting religious sentiments at the Elgar Parishad held in January this year in Pune. “Strict action will be taken against Usmani. No one will be spared. You (BJP) should also not have two positions on the country and state’s social security,” he said without naming any party. He also remindedof a journalist without naming anyone that he was arrested in a case for abetment to suicide. “There are allegations against the journalist of disclosing serious and confidential information regarding the country’s security. This journalist had expressed joy after the country’s soldiers were martyred in the Pulwama terror attack,” said Pawar. Pawar said when the said journalist was arrested in another case some legislators even sat on a hunger protest outside Mantralaya. “No one who works against nation’s interest must be supported. We all should take sensible positions. This is my view and the view of the Maha Vikas Aghadi too,” he said. Pawar hinting at some relief in petrol and diesel prices said the Centre collects Rs 35.90 per litre of petrol and of this Rs 32.90 is collected as cess whereas the state government is collecting Rs 28.90 as value added tax. “Our government has not increased the tax on petrol and diesel. We are thinking of certain changes which I shall announce in my budget speech on March 8,” he said. The government, he said, was committed to the overall development of Maharashtra and would ensure that the Development Board for Marathwada, Vidarbha and Rest of Maharashtra will receive the same quantum of funds as in the past. The Board headed by the Governor is yet to be constituted. Pawar had earlier said that when the Governor approves the appointment of 12 members to the Upper House as proposed by the state government, the board will be constituted. Referring to the covid crisis management by the government, Pawar said it did not slash budgets for food and civil supplies, police, public health and medical department. “Rather we recruited additional man power to tackle the crisis,” he said.

968,KALYANI,['20-year-old'],Counsellor at IISER to help prevent suicides,"KALYANI: IISER (Kolkata) on Thursday appointed Calcutta University’s psychology professor Pritha Mukhopadhyay to help it in its efforts to put in place a “robust student-counselling system” to prevent depression-induced suicides. A 20-year-old student, Sagar Mandal, was found hanging in the institute hostel on Monday. He was struggling with English language skills and was depressed. Mukhopadhyay, who reached IISER’s Mohanpur campus on Thursday evening, had several sessions with students. She met senior academics and reportedly suggested IISER teachers be encouraged to stay on the institute’s Kalyani campus with their families. Mukhopadhyay reasoned since the students came here leaving their families from different demographics and cultural backgrounds, the sight of academics and their families on the same campus would go a long way to bolster their self- confidence. She also felt while external experts, like her, could deal with one-off cases, IISER should put in place a student counselling cell to deal with the issue on a regular basis. Mukhopadhyay will give her detailed feedback to IISER on each of these issues. A wary IISER had asked all 170 students who were set to appear for their mathematics paper on Thursday to take a break if they wanted to. However, barring two students, all appeared for their examinations. Why two students chose to be absent was not known yet but they will be allowed to re-appear for the test on May 14. However, all three batchmates implicated in the FIR in connection to Sagar’s death took the test. CPM MP Ritabrata Bandopadhyay on Thursday reached out to the victim’s family — on the day Sagar’s shradh ceremony was being held at his home. The local Trinamool Congress leadership also reached out to the family by promising them a home under the Geetanjali scheme and a job for Sagar’s elder sister Rekha. The family was also provided Rs 10,000 for Sagar’s last rites. ",05-05-2017,"['struggling', 'depressed', 'issue', 'issues', 'wary', 'break', 'death']"

He’s suspected to have taken the extreme step sometime between July 29 and July 31. Police have found a nine-page suicide note in the room which states that he suffered from depression, a signed cheque of Rs 4 lakh pasted on a wall, an anaesthesia bottle and a syringe. A case has been registered at Mangaluru South police station and an investigation is underway. Prasad HK, a native of Davangere, was a final year MD (Pathology) student of Fr Muller Medical College. According to police, the suicide came to light on Monday when calls made by Prasad’s family members on his mobile phone elicited no response, following which they contacted his friends. When Prasad’s friends went to his hostel room, they found him dead. They then informed the hostel warden and police. Before committing suicide, Prasad signed a cheque of Rs 4 lakh in the name of his elder brother, a physician. Police said the nine-page suicide note confirmed that he suffered from depression. Cops are investigating how Prasad procured local anaesthesia without prescription. “We will conduct a detailed probe. Everything recovered from the room will be sent to forensic science laboratory,” said Hanumantharaya, DCP (Traffic and Crime). “While local anaesthesia used for minor surgeries such as removal of wart or sutures is freely available, those used for major surgeries and included Schedule H drug category are only available to qualified anaesthetists,” said a practicing anaesthetist. A senior functionary at Father Muller Charitable Institution privy to the developments told TOI that it was unethical from a doctor to self-administer anaesthesia without proper prescription. He said that Prasad was undergoing treatment for depression and that he consumed alcohol in large quantity and other drugs before ending his life. He had a Karnataka Medical Council number and might have used it to procure local anaesthesia for himself. The incident comes close on the heels of a SSLC student committing suicide at Alva’s Education Foundation.

According to the students’ leaders the management has agreed to dismiss the vice principal M K Sakthivel, PRO Sanjit Vaiswanathan, and the faculties C P Praveen, M S Govindankutty and Irshad. They said they called off the agitation after the principal in-charge G Kalivarathan, signed the dismissal order and also gave a written undertaking to implement all the points agreed at the mediation talks convened by the Thrissur district collector Dr A Kowsigan on February 15. The agreed points include no repressive actions against the students who have launched the agitation and permit the students to complaints about the internal marks within seven days after publishing in the college website . The students will be permitted to form college union and the PTA will be reconstituted in a transparent manner. The students resumed their agitation on Wednesday noon demanding dismissal of the PRO, vice principal, and three faculty members who are allegedly involved in the case relating to the unnatural death of Jishnu.

Since the beginning of the current academic year, more than 20 inter students have reportedly committed suicide.Worried by this alarming trend activists and teachers feel it is time that government makes it compulsory for these colleges to employ counsellors to address the concerns of students. ""Between 1995 and 2000, more than 1,400 students committed suicide pushing the government to form a committee to look into the reasons for these suicides. After a thorough study , the committee recommended employing counsellors in the colleges. But, unfortunately , no college has implemented the recommendation. It's high time they do it as the current situation is more or less the same as it was during that period,"" said P Madhusudhan Reddy , president, Government Inter Colleges Association. He further said that as per the committee's recommendations, a criminal case should be booked against the college management (where a is suicide reported) and that it is an appropriate time to consider all the recommendations. Members of the Telangana Private Junior Colleges Managements Association, while seconding the proposition, said that the guidelines categorically mention that colleges, especially those which are residential, must have counsellors or psycholo gists. Yet, not many follow the rules as the board does not take strict action against the violators. ""Just having some guidelines in place is not going to solve any problem. Scores of precious lives are being lost because of pressure and the government or board are least bothered. If they take action against the erring colleges, we can certainly curb this problem and save the lives of students,"" said G Satish, who owns a private junior college. City psychologists further said that forcing students to follow a `prison like regime' can either make them aggressive or depressed.

The court’s decision is expected on Thursday. The interim bail that was originally granted to Krishnadas on February 16 was extended by the court again on Tuesday. Extension of the interim bail followed the completion of hearing of the arguments of special prosecutor CP Udayabhanu and the counsel representing Krishnadas. During the hearing on Tuesday, Krishnadas’ counsel questioned representation of the state government by the special prosecutor instead of the director general of prosecution. The special prosecutor is appearing in the case without the permission of the state government or the director general of prosecution, the counsel argued. Following such a contention by the petitioner’s counsel, the court directed the state government to bring clarity in the matter of its representation and asked to inform whether the special prosecutor has been authorized to argue in the case at the high court. When the case was again taken up for hearing in the afternoon, director general of prosecution informed the court that the special prosecutor has been authorized to represent the government in the case at the high court. Following this, the court proceeded to hear the government’s version on the plea for anticipatory bail. The special prosecutor opposed the bail plea and argued that evidence regarding the involvement of Krishnadas and other accused has been obtained during investigation and bail should, therefore, be denied. State government has already filed a written statement opposing the bail plea, he said. Upon completion of hearing, the court then reserved the case for pronouncing orders.

While the circular was issued by the chief education officer in Karur, the same questions are also being raised in other districts like Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram, said teachers' associations. Teachers felt the topic of suicides has to be handled sensitively and shows teachers in poor light. Some also said the perspectives may differ in each case of suicide and placing the blame on teachers can be done very easily without understanding the repercussions. ""A teacher's entire reputation may be at stake if an accusation is taken for serious consideration,"" said Aravind, a teacher of a state board school in the city. State president of the Tamil Nadu Teachers Association, P K Ilamaran said it is wrong to send out such a circular. Such issues should be discussed at parent-teacher meetings or call for a separate discussion with teachers on handling such instances, he said. ""Nowadays, teachers have become wary because children point fingers at them for even reprimanding them. When the department also sends out such circulars, it gives out a wrong message because teachers would feel that the department too is turning against them,"" he said. School education secretary Pradeep Yadav remarked the drafting of the circular was not done in the right manner given the sensitivity of the issue. Teachers felt that moral and value education as a concept also is not being taught properly to children who don't treat their peers or teachers with the respect and right attitude. Incidentally, school education minister K A Sengottaiyan also announced that new areas of value education will be incorporated into the curriculum module. State Council for Educational Research and Training (SCERT) director Arivoli said that the Value Integrated Teaching and Learning (VITAL) module had been distributed to schools last September but now will involve new areas of focus which will especially be incorporated along with Social Science lessons and language texts.

In a series of videos, Siddiqui had made derogatory claims about the Maharashtra ministers as well as some actors. Siddiqui’s lawyer J P Jaiswal said, “Rashid is a YouTuber and whatever videos he had uploaded were not made by him. He is not an investigator nor has he aired his own opinions. He has put question marks in all his videos and the information has been collected from various sources.” Police investigations have suggested Siddiqui earned Rs 6.5 lakh by spreading fake news on social media in four months. “I have all the records with me.

The family members, still clueless about the reason behind Sakshi’s drastic step, are trying to connect the daughter’s suicide with her father’s as they had a special bond despite staying separately. The family sources claimed Shashikant’s suicide seemed to have adversely affected Sakshi. Shashikant, an autorickshaw driver, used to stay with a friend at Indora and not at home as he had a difference with wife Seema who supported the family by working at a hostel. A relative said Sakshi had developed some uneasiness for the last couple of days. “She was normal and had done household chores earlier in the day. There was no indication from her words or even mood to gauge she would take the step later in the day. She had also spoken at length with a neighbour,” said the relative. “There was some frustration within her which may have compelled her to take the decision to end life,” he said. The family members also informed Sakshi was a good student and had scored well in her Standard VIII final examinations. It is learnt Seema had advised Sakshi to go her maternal uncle’s place which is in the vicinity before leaving for work as she had complained of uneasiness. Sakshi’s elder sister, Anchal, was at her maternal uncle’s place. Anchal was expecting Sakshi to reach at maternal uncle’s place too. As she did not turn up, Anchal and her maternal grandmother Sanghamitra went to Sakshi’s place to enquire about her health. Anchal and Sanghamitra got worried as there was no response from inside after repeated knocks on the door. They alerted a neighbour who came to their help. She spotted Sakshi hanging from the ceiling after peeping through the window. Police were alerted. No suicide note was found. Kapil Nagar police have registered a case of accidental death.

1018,LUCKNOW,['25-year-old'],IIM-L student commits 'suicide' in hostel room,"LUCKNOW: A 25-year-old student of Indian Institute of Management-Lucknow (IIM-L) allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan of his hostel room on Wednesday afternoon. According to the police, Soham Mukherjee was a second-year student pursuing postgraduate programme in management and belonged to Kolkata. He stayed in room number 17 on the campus. One hostel resident told police that Mukherjee was last seen going out to collect a pizza he had ordered at noon on Monday. After that, he did not venture out of the room. Madioan inspector Raghvan Kumar Singh said a foul smell was emanating from the room and he might have hung himself at least 48 hours ago. Police said Mukherjee's hostel friends failed to get a response to knocks on his door around 1.30pm. Phone calls to him also went unanswered. Later, one of them went to the rear and peeped into the room from a raised platform. He saw Mukherjee hanging from a nylon cord tied around his neck. Prasun, a student, rushed to the hostel warden informing him about the incident. The warden then called the police who broke open the door. Since the room was locked from inside, the police prima facie called it as a case of suicide. However, no suicide note was found, said Madion inspector Raghvan Kumar Singh. ""It appears that the student was under depression and thus took the extreme step,"" said Singh, adding the exact motive behind the suicide could not be ascertained yet and further probe was on. Mukherjee's body has been sent for autopsy. ""His mobile phone, laptop and a notebook have been taken for investigation,"" said Singh. Forensics experts took fingerprints and other samples from his room. ",16-11-2017,"['suicide', 'foul', 'smell', 'hung', 'failed', 'broke', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'depression', 'suicide']"

1020,GURUGRAM,[],"Death in school: Teachers in jail, 1,570 students skip exams, seek their release","GURUGRAM: Nearly 1,570 students of Mewat Model School, Nuh, from classes II to XI walked out of the exam hall on Monday to protest against the arrest of three of their teachers, more than two months after a Class XII Arts student was found hanging in her hostel room. The students have threatened not to sit for their final exams till the teachers are released from jail. At around 4pm on December 19, Renu was found hanging in her hostel room. Her family lodged an FIR the same day, refusing to accept it as a case of suicide. Three teachers who were residing on the school campus, Mahabir Singh, Archana Saraswat and Shah Alam, were arrested under Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of IPC on March 1. According to the family, the arrests were delayed as no one was listening to them because they are poor. Mahabir Singh is a sports teacher who has served in different Mewat model schools for nearly 30 years. Archana Saraswat retired as a teacher in 2009 but was working at the school on contract for the past nine years. She was also serving as the hostel warden. Shah Alam was a junior faculty in geography as well as Renu’s class teacher. Afsana, a Class XII student, said, “We will not give our exams till our teachers are released. On March 22, a bail application was placed. If the teachers don’t get bail, we will go on an indefinite hunger strike.” According to the school, the girl was admitted in the school in July 2016 despite her poor performance in the Class X Haryana Board exams and the entrance test. The school alleged that Renu’s father Rohtash had requested them to provide hostel facilities to the girl for her own safety. The hostel warden, Archana Saraswat, had repeatedly warned her against bunking classes, friendships with boys and irregular attendance, said the school, adding that she was even rusticated from the hostel for two months and admitted again on parental request. One of the teachers said, “On the day of the incident, the girl had bunked class and was found sitting with a cellphone which was given to her by a boy. In the entire episode, that boy has escaped without a scratch while the teachers are being blamed for everything.” The district administration conducted an enquiry into the death. According to its report, Renu was mad about a boy called Mustkeem. On the day of the incident, the girl was caught with a mobile phone by her teacher, Shah Alam. The hostel warden allegedly slapped her on finding out about the mobile phone. Before the incident, the girl told her roommate Neha that her father had threatened to marry her off to someone she did not know. The girl’s father, Rohtash, said, “We got a call from Nafis, an official of the school, saying that Renu is sick and has been admitted in the emergency ward of Shaheed Hasan Khan Mewati (SHKM) government medical college in Nuh. When I saw my daughter, she was not responding and the doctor said she had been brought dead. I feel that she was murdered. I was coerced by the school authorities to take the body home without a post-mortem and to not approach the police.” According to the post-mortem and Palwal forensic science laboratory reports, the cause of death was hanging.

1023,CUBA,"['18-year-old', '15-year-old']",Cut off: School closings leave rural students isolated,"CUBA: The midday arrival of a school bus at Cyliss Castillo's home on the remote edge of a mesa breaks up the long days of boredom and isolation for the high school senior. The driver hands over food in white plastic bags, collects Castillo's school assignments and offers some welcome conversation before setting out for another home. The closing of classrooms and the switch to remote learning because of the coronavirus have left Castillo and other students in this school district on the sparsely populated fringe of the Navajo Nation in New Mexico profoundly isolated - cut off from direct human contact and, in many cases, unconnected to the grid. Like many of his neighbors, Castillo does not have electricity, let alone internet. It is yet another way in which the pandemic has exposed the gap between the haves and have-nots in the U.S. ""There's not a lot to do here. You clean up, pick up trash or build stuff. Like, I built that shed right there,"" the 18-year-old Castillo said, pointing at a pitched-roof plywood shed. ""Hopefully, hopefully by next semester we'll be going back into school,"" he said. ""I don't like online. I like to be, you know, in school, learning. That's just not me. I just find it a lot easier and a lot better than just out here, not doing nothing."" The Cuba Independent School District, centered in a village of 800 people, has kept the buses running as a way to bring school to far-flung students who live on a vast checkboard of tribal, federal and county land. On their routes, the buses carry school assignments, art supplies, meals and counselors who check in with students who are struggling with online bullying, abuse, thoughts of suicide or other problems. The buses are a lifeline for families in the Cuba school district, of whom nearly half are Hispanic and half are Native American, including many Navajo-speaking English-language learners. Many do not have running water. Castillo and others with no electricity charge their school-issued laptops with car batteries or at a relative's house. One student has sent her laptop on the buses to be charged at school. This far out, internet service is unavailable or prohibitively expensive. For students without home internet, the buses bring USB drives loaded with assignments and video lessons from teachers. Some students like Castillo eventually asked for paper packets because of the difficulty in charging laptops. With Covid-19 cases spiking in New Mexico to their highest levels yet, it is unclear when the district will begin offering in-person classes again. The district has a record of adapting to challenges, and a high school graduation rate of 83% - well above the state average - to show for it. It has long employed a ""community school"" approach in which social workers, nurses and teachers help students around the clock, not just during the school day, on the theory that they will do better academically if their home life can be made better. All students were issued Chromebooks in 2019, well before the coronavirus outbreak. That made the shift to distance learning easier in March when school buildings shut down. Other rural districts around the country have likewise been engineering ways to connect with students who are otherwise disengaged during the pandemic. In San Joaquin, California, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Fresno, the Golden Plains Unified School District found early in the pandemic that students were out working rather than doing schoolwork. ""We would have kids call from the fields. They were picking peaches,"" said Andre Pecina, an assistant superintendent, who noted only 40% of high school students were participating in distance learning. ""Once Covid happened, parents were like, `Let's go to work.""' To bring students back into the fold, the district reached out to parents by phone to set teacher conferences early in the school year and ordered hundreds of internet hot spots. It is also delivering school materials and electronic devices to students. In New Mexico, before the buses set out from Cuba High School each day, about 25 cafeteria workers, bus drivers and other staff spend over an hour loading them with milk, produce, prepared meals, toilet paper and other necessities for the families. On board one day in late October was head district counselor Victoria Dominguez, who was checking on two students who had suicidal thoughts. She was bringing one a pair of skateboard shoes. In the spring, a screening system for messages sent by students flagged one or two a week as showing signs of possible emotional trouble. Now she is seeing dozens in single week. ""I'm worried for the winter months. It's going to get darker. It's going to get colder and you can't go outside,"" Dominguez said. As Covid-19 rates spiked, the school switched to making bus deliveries every other day, instead of every day. ""They'll still get the same amount of food, but they won't get the same amount of human contact,"" she said. The road from the high school turned from asphalt to gravel to deeply rutted dirt. The oak and pine trees gave way to sagebrush and gaunt junipers before the bus came to halt in front of a cluster of houses. Students poured out to greet the bus driver, Kelly Maestas. He asked them how they were doing and handed out lunches. Dominguez went to shoot baskets with some of the older kids. Among them was 15-year-old Autumn Wilson, a shy sophomore whose father died after she started high school last year. Then school shut down. Now she can't play on the volleyball team anymore. Dominguez connected her with a therapist on an earlier visit. Autumn said the sadness over the loss makes it difficult for her to finish schoolwork. But she finds joy riding horses when her grandfather takes her to the family corral. And she looks forward to the visits from Maestas, who brought her candy for her birthday. ""Kelly, he's really funny to talk to. And if you're feeling sad you can really talk to him,"" she said, ""and you can trust him.""

Police said the doctor, Sheshadri Gowda, who was working in the medicine department of the hospital, has stated in his suicide note that he was suffering from “psychiatric illness”. Gowda hailed from Karnataka and was sharing the flat with another GMCH doctor, who was on emergency duty for three days in the hospital, and called him around 1pm. The room mate approached the Beghumpura police after Gowda neither answered his phone calls nor opened the door. Police inspecter Sachin Sanap said his team immediately went to the flat. “A duplicate key had to be made to open the door since the doctor did not respond to constant knocking of the door. He was found lying on the bed with self-administered IV fluid and several injections next to him.” The doctor was taken to the GMCH where he was declared brought dead. The post mortem will be conducted on Tuesday. Until late Monday evening, no case was registered. Sanap said the suicide note found at the Gowda’s flat states that he suspects that he is suffering from a psychiatric illness and for the last 15 days, he was having episodes of depression and was unable to take decisions, which led him to take the extreme step of ending his life. Gowda got his MD medicine from GMCH Aurangabad. He completed the PG course in May 2019 and was awarded with gold medal from Maharashtra University of Health Sciences for his performance in the course. Gowda was appointed assistant professor in the medicine department of GMCH Aurangabad in June 2019. Kanan Yelikar, dean of GMCH, said that Gowda was a very sincere student and doctor and that the incident is unfortunate. Gowda’s teaching faculty, including head of department of medicine Meenakshi Bhattacharya, associate professor P Jirvankar and head of geriatrics department Mangala Borkar hailed him as intelligent, efficient and sincere. The MBBS students in the medical college, whom Gowda taught, said that he was a good very teacher and enjoyed full attendance.

1030,MUMBAI,['26-year-old'],"Three accused doctors destroyed Payal Tadvi suicide note, say cops","MUMBAI: In a significant twist to the Dr Payal Tadvi case, it has emerged that the post-graduate medical student had left behind a three-page handwritten note before committing suicide on May 22 blaming three doctors, who have been arrested, of humiliation and harassment, police sources told TOI on Thursday.  The note itself is missing, but photographs of the pages were retrieved by state forensic laboratory officials from the 26-year-old Tadvi's cellphone, a source said. Tadvi seemed to have clicked pictures of the note and stored them on her cellphone, but the accused doctors, who were among the first to reach Tadvi's room after her suicide, had allegedly deleted them, the source added.  Dr Hema Ahuja, 28, Dr Bhakti Mehare, 26, and Dr Ankita Khandelwal, 27, - Tadvi's seniors at the medical college attached to B Y L Nair Hospital - were arrested on May 28-29 and are in judicial custody. Tadvi, who belonged to the Tadvi Bhil tribe, committed suicide by hanging in her hostel room. Her family alleged that she was harassed over her caste by the arrested doctors.  The suicide note details the harassment and torture she allegedly faced at the hands of the accused. It has mentioned each and every instance of humiliation over a one-year period, said the sources. Tadvi has mentioned how each of them tormented her about her caste and made her do additional work as punishment, they added.  Kalina Forensic Science Laboratories (FSL) gave Tadvi's cellphone report to the crime branch recently. On Thursday, police submitted a confidential report containing details of their findings to the Bombay high court, which is hearing the bail application of the three doctors. The police, in its nine-page reply, have mentioned that the three doctors were the first to reach Tadvi's room on May 22 after her suicide was discovered. The police are likely to invoke additional charges of Indian Penal Code Section 201 for destruction of evidence in the case. Officials could retrieve data, including the deleted suicide note pictures, from Tadvi's phone which was in a good condition, said source, adding the hard copy of the suicide note is yet to be traced though, and could have been destroyed. ""This is a key piece of evidence against the accused and we may seek their police custody for further questioning."" Police are not allowed to question the accused when they are in judicial custody. The existence of a suicide note was one of the key arguments put forward by the Tadvi's family lawyer during the bail application hearing at the special court on June 24. The prosecution also contended that the entry of two doctors into Dr Tadvi's room who spent five minutes there after accompanying the group carrying the body till the lift indicated that something was amiss. Their images were captured on CCTV. ""Now, on the basis of the FSL finding, we have come to the conclusion that the accused doctors allegedly destroyed the suicide note while the other doctors were moving Tadvi's body out of her room,"" said another source. A special court had denied the three doctors’ bail application on June 24.

1034,BHUBANESWAR,[],Abetment of suicide case registered in Taniya Banerjee's death,"BHUBANESWAR: Taniya Banerjee’s alleged suicide on Tuesday may invite trouble for some of her friends and authorities of DAV school of business management (DSBM) where she was pursing her Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA). The Capital police station here on Wednesday registered a case of abetment of suicide against some of the students and officials of DSBM. On Tuesday, Taniya’s mother Keya lodged a complaint, accusing some of her daughter’s friends and school authorities of subjecting her to mental torture that drove her to end her life. Keya alleged Taniya’s friends suspected her as a thief. She alleged the DSBM authorities did precious little to protect the girl. ""We have booked some of the DSBM students and officials for abetting the suicide under section 306 of IPC. We constituted a five-member team of personnel to probe the circumstances leading to her suicide,"" deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi told TOI. The probe personnel on Wednesday visited DSBM campus and questioned at least ten students and some faculty members. Since Taniya’s body was found hanging from a room of the hostel on the campus, the cops quizzed the hostel warden and security guards. Taniya’s roommate was also interrogated, sources said. Police said though each room of the DSBM hostel is shared by two girls, Taniya was alone in one of the rooms. ""We were told by the DSBM authorities that her roommate had gone to another friend’s room to sleep on Monday. Taniya slept alone in the room and was found hanging the next day,"" a police officer said. ""My daughter was ostracised by others in the hostel. Some of her seniors and juniors used to throw tantrums at her for past few days by branding her a thief. They had stopped interacting with her. That was the reason why my daughter was in deep shock and trauma,"" Keya said. In her complaint, Keya blamed some officials of DSBM for her daughter’s suicide. While the DSBM authorities were not available for comment, the institute’s principal D N Mishra already rubbished the allegations. ""We were not informed by anyone whether Taniya faced any problem in the hostel. Everybody interacted with her friendly,"" Mishra told on Tuesday. In a related development, a social activist on Wednesday moved the Odisha human rights commission (OHRC), seeking adequate compensation to the victim’s family and stringent action against those responsible for her suicide.

1048,NEW DELHI,"['37-year-old', '50-year-old']","Stress, self-injuries and suicide: India battles mental health crisis as Covid tally spikes","NEW DELHI: Hemmed inside their homes for months on end as a pandemic raged outside, millions of people are emerging timorously into a world that has drastically changed -- an uneasy adjustment process resulting in a spectrum of mental health issues ranging from depression to that final step, suicide. The dread of contracting the disease combined with the realisation that the incidence of Covid-19 spiralled instead of being contained in the lockdown and that the days of suspending life as they knew it could extend indefinitely has been profoundly disturbing for many. Add to this new normal, ill-health, joblessness, financial crises and the everyday stresses that people anyway had to deal with and the Covid-19 tunnel stretches dark and seemingly endless with no light at the end of it. ""This prolonged uncertainty has led people to feel a lot more anxious. So people who were on a mild anxiety spectrum earlier have moved to moderate and severe anxiety. When anxiety gets severe, the kinds of behaviour of self harm increase,"" said Arvinder Singh, psychologist, psychotherapist and director of the Ashoka Centre for Well-Being in New Delhi. As India's Covid-19 tally crossed 47.5 lakh with 94,372 new cases reported on Sunday, Singh's concerns find echo across the country. The worries are rooted in reports of more people inflicting injuries on themselves, several ending their lives and many complaining of depression and severe anxiety. In Gujarat, for instance, the 108 emergency ambulance service received about 800 cases of ""self injuries"" and 90 cases of suicide in April, May, June and July, officials said. The numbers began to spike soon after the nationwide lockdown, which came into effect on March 25. Vikas Bihani, 108 service official, said the suicide prevention and counselling helpline usually got around eight to nine calls per month but the numbers have doubled since March. ""Between March and August, we got 142 calls from depressed people. A majority of the callers were facing economic, family or mental health related issues and wanted to end their lives,"" he said. Some people who test positive for coronavirus inflict injuries on themselves because they cannot tolerate ""disappointment"", B N Gangadhar, director of the Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS), told PTI. His colleague V Senthil Kumar Reddi, coordinator at NIMHANS' department of psychiatry, said the reasons behind cases of self-inflicting injuries need to be studied. Gujarat-based psychologist Prashant Bhimani said the economic crisis is fuelling ""suicidal thoughts"". ""There is a 70 per cent increase in the number of patients suffering from depression and obsessive compulsive disorder due to the coronavirus. People are worried about what will happen to them if they contract the coronavirus, €? he added. Though there are no exact figures, the anecdotal evidence of people choosing to end their lives is mounting. Just last week, a newly married couple were found hanging in their home in Panipat. Aawed (28) and his wife Nazma (19) had got married barely a month back, according to reports. Aawed was upset at losing his job as a welder during the lockdown and was hoping to get work in the unlock period. But that did not happen and he got increasingly desperate, his brother Jawed was reported as saying. In Uttar Pradesh, migrant labourers Chutku and Rambabu ended their lives in their village in Banda. Both had no work and were stressed, their family members said. The distress cuts across classes. In Barabanki, 37-year-old Vivek whose business had failed allegedly poisoned his wife and three children before hanging himself at his home. In the national capital, two brothers, both in their 40s, were found hanging in their jewellery shop in Chandni Chowk. They left behind a suicide note, apologising to their families and citing financial crisis as the reason behind the extreme step. And sometimes, it's just about the disease. A 50-year-old man in Odisha's Bolangir district, for instance, allegedly killed himself by jumping into a well after his nephew tested positive. He feared he might also have contracted Covid-19. The stories of mounting stress and the inability to handle it are many and from all parts of the country.  €œThere are common anxiety issues €¦ like whether they have contracted Covid. People feel anxious if they have a common cold or cough. They are also worried about jobs, economy and EMIs. They are worried about the uncertainty of the future."" said Samir Parikh, director, Mental Health and Behavioural Science, Fortis Healthcare, The numbers of patients being referred to the psychiatry department of Lucknow's King George's Medical University has gone up significantly, said Adarsh Tripathi, additional professor at the department. ""Economic activities came to a halt, businesses shut down. Besides, insecurity about the future, jobs, marriages and education all had a direct psychological impact, €? he added. In Tripathi's view, the 15-25 age group is most vulnerable to self-harm and suicidal ideas. Kolkata-based psychologist Sanchita Pakrashi said the single most important factor is collective anxiety about the future. ""I am getting patients of all ages. Till February, the complaints came mainly from students and young professionals suffering from job stress and personal crisis. Now it is collective crisis which shows no sign of abating,"" she said. Jaipur-based psychiatrist R K Solanki agreed. He said cases of anxiety disorders, stress and suicidal thoughts have increased in the last three-four months, most related with situations emanating from the lockdown and the spread of the coronavirus. ""During lockdown, people were mostly emotionally depressed. Now, worries related to the future are among the main reasons for anxiety and depression in many young patients,"" Solanki said. The coronavirus pandemic may also impact some children's mental health and emotional well-being and parents should address their needs with compassion and a friendly approach, added S K Mattoo, head of the psychiatry department at PGIMER, Chandigarh. Faced with the escalating mental health crisis, several institutions are conducting programmes for their staff. AIIMS, Patna, has tied up with Medicins San Frontiers to provide training to its medicos and paramedical staff on how to deal with the mentally disturbed or depressed Covid-19 patients at the hospital. About 30 per cent of coronavirus patients at the facility are found to be mentally disturbed, Sanjeev Kumar, the institute's Covid-19 nodal officer, said. Anand Nadkarni from Mumbai's Institute of Psychological Health recommends a 30-day crash course on clinical psychology for regular practitioners so they can provide basic support to patients complaining of stress and anxiety.  €œThere is no doubt that the cases of people suffering from stress, anxiety and depression are on the rise. The lockdown has not only led to a relapse in people who were on the recovery path, but also triggered stress and anxiety related disorders among those who earlier never had any symptoms, €?

1049,AURANGABAD,"['24-year-old', '26-year-old']",HC quashes case against woman for man’s death,"AURANGABAD: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court quashed an FIR filed against a 24-year-old female student for abetting the suicide of a 26-year-old man in December 2017. The woman had approached the high court seeking to quash the FIR registered against her by Begumpura police under sections 306, 506 and 34 of the IPC following a complaint from the deceased’s younger brother. The deceased, Ganesh, a student who pursued masters in computer scinece, and his younger brother Umesh Kopurwad were putting up at the hostel on the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University campus. The bench, comprising Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar, observed, “from the bare reading of the FIR, in which the contents of the suicide note are incorporated, it is evident that the contents do not even remotely indicate that the applicant had instigated the deceased to commit suicide or had intentionally aided the commission of the suicide by the deceased. ’’ On September 12, 2017, when Umesh came back to the room of his hostel around 1.10pm, he found that it was locked from inside. When he saw through the slit of the door, he found Ganesh hanging from the ceiling of the room. They informed police, who found a suicide mentioning that the woman was moving around with other boys. The bench observed that the “contents do not indicate that the petitioner created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no alternative than to commit suicide’’. On the contrary, the bench remarked “the contents of the suicide note, as narrated in the FIR, indicate that the deceased did not like the petitioner to be friendly with other boys.” While referring to a line in the suicide note that read ‘she continued going to movies with the boys and moving around with them on the bike’, the court observed, “this indicates that the deceased did not like the petitioner to be friendly with other boys.’’ Thus, the bench said, “it cannot be said that the petitioner had an intention to bring about the suicide of the deceased or that she had created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no alternative than to commit suicide or instigate the deceased to commit suicide. Therefore, the petition will have to be allowed.’’ ",24-10-2020,"['suicide', 'quash', 'complaint', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'instigate', 'suicide']"

The incident ran shockwaves across the IIM-A fraternity as it could well be the first suicide of a student on the six decades old campus. The deceased was identified as Drishti Raj Kahnani, 25, who stayed in dorm number 8 in old IIM-A campus and hailed from Muzaffarpur in Bihar. According to Satellite police officers, the incident took place at around 2.30 pm on Wednesday when her friends tried to open door of her dorm and as she was not responding to their shouts, they broke the door and found her hanging with a ceiling fan, said inspector JB Agrawat of Satellite police. Sources in police said that she had locked herself in the room since morning and she did not go for lunch which raised suspicion amongst her friends who went and tried to meet her but found her dead. Agrawat said that students called up security incharge of the campus and the doctor who found her dead called police to the campus. “When we reached there, we found her dead with a dupatta trying tightly on her neck which was tied with a ceiling fan,” said Agrawat. He said that a forensic officer was also called on the spot who prima facie found that she died on Wednesday afternoon only. On reasons behind suicide, Agrawat said, “We have not found any suicide note from her room. We have attached her cellphone for investigation which was sent to the forensic science laboratory to analyse and to find if she had written something in it.” Her parents were informed about the death who are supposed to reach the city on Thursday morning, said Agrwat adding that her body was sent for post mortem in Sola Civil hospital. Satellite police registered a case of accidental death and began an investigation. The institute in its response said that the IIM-A is committed to overcome this situation. ‘The Institute is deeply grieved to share the news about the untimely demise of our second year MBA student Ms. Drishti Raj in her room in Dorm 8 today evening,’ mentioned an email response from the institute to TOI. ‘The Institute assures and is committed to overcome this situation, dealing with compassion and offering enduring support to the bereaved members of Ms. Drishti's family and the IIMA community at large.’ “We are still to come to terms with the incident.

Prima facie, it seems, Dhrubajyoti Deb committed suicide. Hailing from Durgapur’s B Zone, Deb was a student of University of Engineering and Management, New Town. A senior officer from Bidhannagar police said, a severed friendship might have led him to end his life. “We did not find any suicide note. We are waiting for the post-mortem report,” he said. “We have registered a case of unnatural death and are investigating further,” said a police officer. Apparently, Deb was not responding to repeated calls by his family and landlord. His roommate had gone to Durgapur as he was ill.“We we went to the youth’s apartment around 8.40am and broke open the door,” an officer said. Deb’s father Debabrata said they have no clue why their extroverted son would take such a step. “I’m too shocked to guess the reason behind his death. The cops have seized his laptop and mobile. I hope they find an explanation soon,” Debabrata said. Deb’s father said their son regularly spoke to his mother over phone and had even visited them at Durgapur recently.

1053,NEW DELHI,"['37-year-old', '50-year-old']","Stress, self-injuries and suicide: India battles mental health crisis as Covid tally spikes","NEW DELHI: Hemmed inside their homes for months on end as a pandemic raged outside, millions of people are emerging timorously into a world that has drastically changed -- an uneasy adjustment process resulting in a spectrum of mental health issues ranging from depression to that final step, suicide. The dread of contracting the disease combined with the realisation that the incidence of Covid-19 spiralled instead of being contained in the lockdown and that the days of suspending life as they knew it could extend indefinitely has been profoundly disturbing for many. Add to this new normal, ill-health, joblessness, financial crises and the everyday stresses that people anyway had to deal with and the Covid-19 tunnel stretches dark and seemingly endless with no light at the end of it. ""This prolonged uncertainty has led people to feel a lot more anxious. So people who were on a mild anxiety spectrum earlier have moved to moderate and severe anxiety. When anxiety gets severe, the kinds of behaviour of self harm increase,"" said Arvinder Singh, psychologist, psychotherapist and director of the Ashoka Centre for Well-Being in New Delhi. As India's Covid-19 tally crossed 47.5 lakh with 94,372 new cases reported on Sunday, Singh's concerns find echo across the country. The worries are rooted in reports of more people inflicting injuries on themselves, several ending their lives and many complaining of depression and severe anxiety. In Gujarat, for instance, the 108 emergency ambulance service received about 800 cases of ""self injuries"" and 90 cases of suicide in April, May, June and July, officials said. The numbers began to spike soon after the nationwide lockdown, which came into effect on March 25. Vikas Bihani, 108 service official, said the suicide prevention and counselling helpline usually got around eight to nine calls per month but the numbers have doubled since March. ""Between March and August, we got 142 calls from depressed people. A majority of the callers were facing economic, family or mental health related issues and wanted to end their lives,"" he said. Some people who test positive for coronavirus inflict injuries on themselves because they cannot tolerate ""disappointment"", B N Gangadhar, director of the Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurological Sciences (NIMHANS), told PTI. His colleague V Senthil Kumar Reddi, coordinator at NIMHANS' department of psychiatry, said the reasons behind cases of self-inflicting injuries need to be studied. Gujarat-based psychologist Prashant Bhimani said the economic crisis is fuelling ""suicidal thoughts"". ""There is a 70 per cent increase in the number of patients suffering from depression and obsessive compulsive disorder due to the coronavirus. People are worried about what will happen to them if they contract the coronavirus, €? he added. Though there are no exact figures, the anecdotal evidence of people choosing to end their lives is mounting. Just last week, a newly married couple were found hanging in their home in Panipat. Aawed (28) and his wife Nazma (19) had got married barely a month back, according to reports. Aawed was upset at losing his job as a welder during the lockdown and was hoping to get work in the unlock period. But that did not happen and he got increasingly desperate, his brother Jawed was reported as saying. In Uttar Pradesh, migrant labourers Chutku and Rambabu ended their lives in their village in Banda. Both had no work and were stressed, their family members said. The distress cuts across classes. In Barabanki, 37-year-old Vivek whose business had failed allegedly poisoned his wife and three children before hanging himself at his home. In the national capital, two brothers, both in their 40s, were found hanging in their jewellery shop in Chandni Chowk. They left behind a suicide note, apologising to their families and citing financial crisis as the reason behind the extreme step. And sometimes, it's just about the disease. A 50-year-old man in Odisha's Bolangir district, for instance, allegedly killed himself by jumping into a well after his nephew tested positive. He feared he might also have contracted Covid-19. The stories of mounting stress and the inability to handle it are many and from all parts of the country.  €œThere are common anxiety issues €¦ like whether they have contracted Covid. People feel anxious if they have a common cold or cough. They are also worried about jobs, economy and EMIs. They are worried about the uncertainty of the future."" said Samir Parikh, director, Mental Health and Behavioural Science, Fortis Healthcare, The numbers of patients being referred to the psychiatry department of Lucknow's King George's Medical University has gone up significantly, said Adarsh Tripathi, additional professor at the department. ""Economic activities came to a halt, businesses shut down. Besides, insecurity about the future, jobs, marriages and education all had a direct psychological impact, €? he added. In Tripathi's view, the 15-25 age group is most vulnerable to self-harm and suicidal ideas. Kolkata-based psychologist Sanchita Pakrashi said the single most important factor is collective anxiety about the future. ""I am getting patients of all ages. Till February, the complaints came mainly from students and young professionals suffering from job stress and personal crisis. Now it is collective crisis which shows no sign of abating,"" she said. Jaipur-based psychiatrist R K Solanki agreed. He said cases of anxiety disorders, stress and suicidal thoughts have increased in the last three-four months, most related with situations emanating from the lockdown and the spread of the coronavirus. ""During lockdown, people were mostly emotionally depressed. Now, worries related to the future are among the main reasons for anxiety and depression in many young patients,"" Solanki said. The coronavirus pandemic may also impact some children's mental health and emotional well-being and parents should address their needs with compassion and a friendly approach, added S K Mattoo, head of the psychiatry department at PGIMER, Chandigarh. Faced with the escalating mental health crisis, several institutions are conducting programmes for their staff. AIIMS, Patna, has tied up with Medicins San Frontiers to provide training to its medicos and paramedical staff on how to deal with the mentally disturbed or depressed Covid-19 patients at the hospital. About 30 per cent of coronavirus patients at the facility are found to be mentally disturbed, Sanjeev Kumar, the institute's Covid-19 nodal officer, said. Anand Nadkarni from Mumbai's Institute of Psychological Health recommends a 30-day crash course on clinical psychology for regular practitioners so they can provide basic support to patients complaining of stress and anxiety.  €œThere is no doubt that the cases of people suffering from stress, anxiety and depression are on the rise. The lockdown has not only led to a relapse in people who were on the recovery path, but also triggered stress and anxiety related disorders among those who earlier never had any symptoms, €? Nadkarni said. The Arunachal Pradesh government is also taking measures to reduce stress among Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment at various care centres and hospitals. ""Besides supportive counselling, treating physicians liaise with psychiatrists and initiate treatment for mild symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, if necessary,"" state Health Secretary P Parthiban said. Thousands of kilometres away in Kerala, a helpline set up by DISHA, a joint venture by the National Health Mission (NHM) and the Department of Health and Family Welfare, has been receiving hundreds of calls a day.

1055,BENGALURU,"['48-year-old', '12-year-old', '12-year-old', '17-year-old']","Floundering chit fund business, creditors’ pressure pushed family to the edge","BENGALURU: A day after a 48-year-old man allegedly killed his 12-year-old son, his wife hanged herself and teenage daughter was rescued by neighbours after a suicide pact went awry in Vibhutipura near HAL township, police on Monday arrested five people, including three women, for abetting the suicide. Investigation revealed Suresh Babu’s family was caught in a vicious cycle of chit fund losses triggered by defaulters and loans availed at exorbitant interest rates to clear other investors’ dues. Babu’s wife, Geetha, a cook, ran the chit fund business. The arrested are Sudha, Manju, his mother Daisy, Prabhavathi and Ram Bahadur, all neighbours of Babu. While Sudha worked as a domestic help, Daisy and Manju were financiers, Prabhavathi was an investor in the chit fund business and Ram Bahadur a security guard. The couple’s debts ran up to Rs 5-6 lakh, cops said, adding that they owed Daisy Rs 40,000. Police are likely to make more arrests. Unable to bear creditors’ pressure, the family decided to commit suicide, said Babu. In the early hours of Sunday, he allegedly hanged his 12-year-old son Varun, while Geetha hanged herself in the next few minutes. The entire act was recorded by their 17-year-old daughter. The suicide pact didn’t go as planned as the daughter began pleading with Babu not to die. She rushed out of the house and began screaming for help, drawing the attention of neighbours, who alerted police. Babu later told media that his wife and son committed suicide over financial issues, but the video which went viral revealed he had hanged his son. According to police, preliminary probe and statements by Babu and his daughter confirmed it was a suicide pact gone awry. Varun was a class 8 student, while his elder sister is a II PU student at a private college. Babu, a sales executive in a private firm, also worked as a delivery agent to repay the loans. Most creditors used to visit his house and abuse Geetha in filthy language, Babu said. Saturday’s threat sparked decisionSunday’s suicide pact was prompted by Saturday’s drama in front of Babu’s house. Geetha had to repay Sudha her investment in the chit fund business. Sudha’s son had recently committed suicide over a love affair. Sudha and the other accused gathered in front of the house and abused Geetha. Sudha threatened Geetha saying she would frame her family members for abetting her son’s suicide. According to DCP (Whitefield) Abdul Ahad, Babu and Geetha were scared of being arrested for a crime they weren’t involved in. Babu came up with the idea of a suicide pact to avoid further humiliation. He first killed his son by hanging him twice using a dupatta, while Geetha hanged herself from the ceiling fan. Babu was supposed to hang himself first but by then, the daughter, who had shot a video of her brother’s killing, backed out. Babu changed his mind at the last minute and concocted the story of his wife and son committing suicide when he was not around, police said. 4 FIRs filed*Case of unnatural death based on Babu’s complaint *Murder case against Babu for killing his son *Abetment to suicide case against Sudha, Manju, his mother Daisy, Prabhavathi and Ram Bahadur *A TV journalist has been booked for airing and circulating video which showed Babu killing his son ‘Daughter shot video to reveal kin’s plight’According to Babu’s statement, his daughter shot the video to ensure media and the authorities got to know of the family’s ordeal. “We wanted the world to know how moneylenders and others harassed us every day,” Babu told police. At one point, he even told his daughter to stay alive to share their tragic story. Police said they have also recovered a suicide note from the spot. It named a few of their relatives for not coming to their rescue and asked them not to attend their funeral. Guard’s claim of Rs 2L dues falseWhile all chit fund investors and Daisy were harassing the couple for money, Ram Bahadur claimed Geetha was supposed to pay him Rs two lakh. But investigators said the claim was fake and he was just taking advantage of the situation. Police said, “Babu said he hadn’t taken any money from the security guard, and Ram Bahadur also failed to produce the required evidence.” ",04-06-2019,"['killed', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'vicious', 'losses', 'exorbitant', 'debts', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'issues', 'suicide', 'abuse', 'filthy', 'threat', 'suicide', 'suicide', 'abused', 'suicide', 'scared', 'crime', 'suicide', 'humiliation', 'killed', 'hang', 'killing', 'suicide', 'unnatural', 'death', 'complaint', 'killing', 'suicide', 'killing', 'plight', 'ordeal', 'harassed', 'tragic', 'suicide', 'fake', 'failed']"

1060,Bareilly,[],​Parents of dead medical student refute suicide angle,"Bareilly: An inconsolable Anadi Dikshit could hardly talk. He had recently lost his daughter Ananya (19) who committed suicide in her hostel room at Sri Ram Murti Smarak Institute of Medical Sciences here on September 6. According to the police, Ananya was under depression which forced her to take the extreme step. However, her parents have denied this. Anadi, a senior engineer with a private company, on Monday alleged to media persons that his daughter had been killed. &ldquo;There were no records of Ananya&rsquo;s entry in the hostel premises in the middle of a lecture, as claimed by college authorities. We were not able to speak to the warden. Neither was there any CCTV footage nor any entries in the log book which could substantiate the authorities&rsquo; claims,&rdquo; Anadi told TOI. Ananya's body was found hanging in her room hardly a fortnight after she joined the institute to study medicine. &ldquo;She had purchased books for the entire course even after college authorities had advised against it. She was bright and meritorious throughout her academic career. Nobody who knew her can believe that she took her own life,&rdquo; Anadi added. The parents have alleged that the college authorities came up with the depression story at the behest of Ananya&rsquo;s roommates. Authorities have said that she would occasionally cry while talking on the phone. The parents have denied these claims. ""She was in constant touch with me over the phone and used to tell me how eagerly she looked forward to her studies at the new college. A depressed and suicidal person can hardly appear normal. There was no change in her behavior in the days prior to her death,&rdquo; Ananya&rsquo;s mother Shailaja Dikshit said. ""If she had called in sick, why was she left on her own and asked to go back to the hostel instead of being provided proper medical attention? Can&rsquo;t a medical college which runs a hospital a stone&rsquo;s throw away manage even that? This is not a suicide. My daughter was murdered,&rdquo; Anadi said, adding that the college authorities were trying to cover up the matter. A case based on the complaint of the family has been lodged at Bhojipura police station here. ""We have registered an FIR under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC. The parents have levelled several charges of irregularities and negligence by college staff, which will now be investigated,&rdquo; senior superintendent of police Jogendra Kumar said. ""We ourselves are shocked that a meritorious student like her took such an extreme step. Her medical condition was examined by the hostel superintendent and there is no reason for allegations of negligence. We will extend all help to the police in the investigation,"" Aditya Murti, director (administration) at the institute told TOI.",11-09-2017,"['inconsolable', 'lost', 'suicide', 'depression', 'denied', 'killed', 'depression', 'denied', 'depressed', 'suicidal', 'death', 'sick', 'suicide', 'complaint', 'suicide', 'negligence', 'shocked', 'allegations', 'negligence']"

1068,BENGALURU,['14-year-old'],Karnataka takes on Blue Whale Challenge,"BENGALURU: Look out for unusual symbols or injuries on the arms and lips of students. That's one of the five directives issued by the Karnataka government to teachers and school managements to tackle the Blue Whale Challenge, an online game that drives players to suicide. Though no Blue Whale-related tragedy has been reported in Karnataka, the education department has decided to take no chances as suicides triggered by the game are rising across the world. The first case of alleged Blue Whale suicide was reported on July 30 in Mumbai when a 14-year-old boy jumped to death from the seventh floor of a building. State public instructions commissioner Sowjanya A is sued a circular directing teachers and parents to ring the alarm bell loud if they notice any weird signs or tattoos and injuries on students' bodies, especially arms and lips. “This is the first major hint about the vulnerability of youngsters to the deadly game,“ an education department official said. The four other directives ued by her to parents and issued by her to parents and teachers are: Watch out for kids who view horror movies continuously, those who wake up at 4.20 am, those who listen to disturbing and bizarre music and those who post depressing messages and selfies on social media. The Blue Whale Challenge, which reportedly originated in Russia, challenges youngsters to engage in a series of harmful behaviour over 50 days. Some of the dares include harming oneself by cutting the skin, isolating oneself, visiting graveyards at night, viewing horror movies, listening to disturbing music and, finally, committing suicide. Survivors said they started playing the game after getting a customized link through social media and they found it difficult to disengage as their personal details were shared with the game's administrator. A Blue Whale victim rescued in Jodhpur said she tried to kill herself to protect her mother whose details were with the game administrator. Sowjanya said in the circular: “It is important to create awareness about the dangers associated with the game and prevent students from falling victims to it. At greater risk are minors who keep getting messages ordering them to complete the tasks assigned.“ The commissioner instructed block education officers to raise awareness levels among students and order internet browsing centres to block access to it.

1069,PATNA,"['37-year-old', '33-year-old']","Patna: Auto drivers struggle amid few customers, low income","PATNA: The movement of public transport may have resumed in the city as part of the relaxations given in the fourth phase of the Covid-19 lockdown, but auto drivers are struggling to make ends meet. They have witnessed a sharp dip in the number of customers hiring their vehicles. 37-year-old Majister Singh, who has been riding an autorickshaw in Patna for the last 15 years, claimed that he had no other source of income. “I have to support a family of four. Since I am unable to earn more than Rs 100 every day, I have to use my savings to buy essential items,” he rued. Another auto driver, Satyendra Singh, pointed out, “Most of my passengers are students and office-goers. Since all schools and colleges and many offices are still shut, I earn only Rs 550 a week. Now, I have started riding my auto on a different route, but I do not see much difference in my income.” The situation of some drivers, who do not have their own autos, is more miserable. After working for an entire day, 33-year-old Sunil Kumar earns only Rs 180, which is not enough to sustain his family. “To make matters worse, I have to give Rs 250 to the owner of the auto and pay Rs 35 for parking the vehicle at the Patliputra station,” he said. Autorickshaws and e-rickshaws started running from May 20 on an odd-even basis with just two passengers. Bihar State Auto Chalak Sangh’s general secretary, Raj Kumar Jha, told this newspaper that traffic police personnel were troubling the drivers by imposing fines on them for not following the odd-even policy. “Less than 50% of the autos are plying on city roads. The government should give the drivers relaxations as they are uneducated and cannot understand what is odd or even,” Jha said. He alleged, “In tough times like these, some traffic cops are issuing challans for non-renewal of road tax and pollution under control certificates in Chitkohra and Rajendra Nagar area.” Patna Autorickshaw Association secretary, Ranjit Kumar Singh, urged the government to ensure that the drivers had a stable source of income. He said, “An auto wallah, Rajesh Pandey, committed suicide at his rented house in Khajekalan on May 25 because he had not earned a single penny in 57 days. He was under a lot of pressure.” ",29-05-2020,"['struggling', 'unable', 'miserable', 'worse', 'troubling', 'imposing', 'suicide']"
